I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured.
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting.
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
So that's what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student.
Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want, so I say: Let the world-changing games begin.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies, animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
In that case, what I've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
For years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex-difference research.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
I was in awe.
And I said to her, "I was looking forward to going to developing countries and doing research and covering stories at the same time." She said, "I don't think so, girlfriend." And that confusion, that mutual confusion, drove us to publish a paper on the conflicting ethics and the contradictory practices of research and reporting.
I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything?
It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together, so I'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
And I realized, at the same time, that it is OK to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene — and not just OK, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
So I went down to the unit and had the pleasure of meeting Anne.
I'm a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, part of the Opera of the Future group, and my research focuses on the relationship people have with their own voice and with the voices of others.
But to exploit the potential of all facades and other areas, such as semitransparent areas, curved surfaces and shadings, I believe organic photovoltaics can offer a significant contribution, and they can be made in any form architects and planners will want them to. Thank you.
Those are my students, and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher, I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice.
I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that.
I strongly believe we can translate the science, bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment.
So I walked up to see her in my lunch break, and my doctor said she was very sorry to tell me that I had breast cancer.
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all that I stood up and I walked around to where she was sitting so that I could look over her shoulder and verify what was written on the page in front of her.
Back at work, I handed over the urgent things that needed to be done while I was having more tests to see if my cancer had spread.
That it would be my coworkers and my job that would make me feel valuable and human at times when I would have otherwise felt like a statistic.
I knew the obvious impacts my diagnosis was going to have on work.
But while I was ready for all the physical side effects, what really scared me was this thing called chemo brain.
And if this happened to me, I wondered how I was going to do my job as a lawyer.
The single biggest investment in my life, and I was amazed how little self-determination, choice and, ultimately, control I had.
What's more, I was doubly surprised at how vulnerable this made me feel.
Frankly, I felt trapped.
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark to address the questions that have bothered me all these years.
I was born in Kigali, Rwanda.
I felt loved by my entire family and my neighbors.
I was drawn to oceanography by just this kind of challenge.
As a college student, I went on an expedition across the Atlantic with a team of scientists using a high-powered laser to measure microscopic algae.
I am convinced that the discoveries awaiting us in the twilight zone will be just as breathtaking.
So I'm a scientist who studies life in the ocean.
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues who share this passion.
I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students.
I don't know — I was furious.
It was the first time we flew it, and the star of the show, of course, brother and sister side boosters landing. I was excited.
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event, and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.
I don't think I'm dumb enough to do something for 16 years that I don't like doing.
But then once I realized that that's his job, and my job is to get the company close to comfortable so he can push again and put us back on that slope, then I started liking my job a lot more, instead of always being frustrated.
GS: I'm personally invested in this one, because I travel a lot and I do not love to travel, and I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.
GS: So I am glad you asked that, but I think we need to expand our minds a little bit.
I am a wild woman, a rebel singer, a conduit.
So as a victims' rights attorney fighting to increase the prospect of justice for survivors across the country and as a survivor myself, I'm not here to say, "Time's Up." I'm here to say, "It's time." It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence.
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s when I first heard those shocking facts and the scientist in me wanted to know why and how.
So I did what anyone appalled by politics would do: I ran for office, and I won.
After all, I was a scientist, I came from the world under attack, and I had personally felt the outrage.
When I was hired by the Free Library in 2013, I specifically chose to work at McPherson because I understand what it's like to grow up in an environment where substance use disorder shapes the everyday, and I wanted to use those personal experiences as a guide for my work.
I struggled in school, struggled to read, I was prone to anger and depression.
And when I finally turned around, I saw the kids — kids that come into the library on a daily basis, some that I have known for years — standing on the steps of the building. They saw everything. And they didn't seem like they were visibly upset or in shock, and so I walked into the building, right into our workroom, and I cried.
This is a catastrophic normal, and in that moment, I was forced to confront once again that this should never be normal, and as with my childhood, when you're in it, you just accept it.
Excited, I bounced to my feet and flipped three more cartwheels before landing by her side.
In our last conversation before her death, she encouraged me to go anywhere in the world that would make me happy.
I had read everything that was written in the newspaper, and that was precisely what drew me to the organization.
I went to Uber with the hopes that a turnaround there could give license to the rest of us who might have narrower versions of their challenges.
But when I got to Uber, I made a really big mistake.
I publicly committed to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day until every other employee was wearing an Uber T-shirt.
Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps,
I have been tempted at every step of my career, tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world.
But I was a super ambitious student growing up.
In middle school and high school, I had straight A's, and I graduated at the top of my year.
So while I was studying anatomy for a competition, I came across the topic of something called chronic wounds.
And I was really struck once I'd drawn this picture to realize that the symbol of well-being in many ancient cultures reflects this very same sense of dynamic balance, from the Maori Takarangi to the Taoist Yin Yang, the Buddhist endless knot, the Celtic double spiral.
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage of the head nurse, Malak, in the aftermath of the bombing, grabbing premature babies out of their incubators, desperate to get them to safety, before she broke down in tears. And I felt devastated.
So when IDA asked for help, I decided to launch CanDo seven months early, with very little money, and many people, including myself, thought I had finally gone mad.
And one day I found myself in my new office on Two Dopey Drive —
So I dived into quantum physics and chaos theory to try to find actual reality, and I've just finished a movie — yes, finally finished — about all that, so I won't go into it here, and anyway, it wasn't until after we shot the movie, when I broke my leg and then it didn't heal, so then they had to do another surgery a year later, and then that took a year — two years in a wheelchair, and that's when I came into contact with actual reality: limits.
I should have known that the moment I fell in love with reality, the rest of the country would decide to go in the opposite direction.
I'm going into the ground just the way I am, and there, I invite every microbe and detritus-er and decomposer to have their fill. I think they'll find me delicious.
And I am so grateful to you.
And I'm starting to get really nervous, because for a long time, no one says anything.
What brings you joy? "I felt like a detective. I was like," When did you last see it?
My specialty, as a sex educator, is I bring the science.
Helen Walters: Emily, come up here. Thank you so much. I know that you do this all the time, and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you for having the courage to come and talk about that on this stage.
Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.
I was born in Korea — the land of kimchi; raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now; and I was educated in the US, where I became addicted to peanut butter.
She scanned all of my classmates, and she said, "You — you have to get a tutor, otherwise, you won't pass this class." But by then I was fluent in Spanish already, so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian, but not both.
And, "You must be Japanese because of your big eyes and your foreign body language." And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian, but too Argentinian to be Korean.
So for example, in high school, I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.
When I was nearly done with my PhD, I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug.
So I went to my very traditional Korean parents, who are here today, with the task of letting them know that I was going to drop out from my PhD program.
And in response, Google supported a few colleagues and me to set up a new group called Jigsaw, with a mandate to make people safer from threats like violent extremism, censorship, persecution — threats that feel very personal to me because I was born in Iran, and I left in the aftermath of a violent revolution.
Now, stay with me for a moment — I'm a violinist, not a singer.
And it was about that time that I became so smitten by these little cells that I redirected my entire lab to study them and nothing else, and my loyalty to them has really paid off.
Well, it makes me happy for Prochlorococcus of course —
As a researcher, a professor and a new parent, my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults.
As someone who's a researcher in this area and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals, I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.
As a parent and as a researcher, I think we can do better.
When I was a kid, I was, like many of you in this room, very much fascinated by Star Wars, and what fascinated me the most is this notion of the Force, this energy that connects all people and all objects and allows you to feel people that you can't even see.
And later in life, I became a scientist.
I'm sure many of you have seen this picture.
So I'm really excited because we have deployed the device with many patients. We have deployed the device with patients that have COPD, which is a pulmonary disease, patients that have Alzheimer's, patients that have depression and anxiety and people that have Parkinson's.
So when I started, I told you that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars and the Force in Star Wars, and indeed, I'm still very much fascinated, even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars, waiting for the next movie.
She has heart failure, and I'm sure many of you guys in the audience have parents, grandparents, loved ones who have chronic diseases.
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.
I was tired of faking normal.
I've had to come out of the shadows, stand here openly, and I'm inviting you to do so as well.
I've had to also let go of magical thinking — this idea that if I just was patient enough and tightened my belt that things would go back to normal.
I'm ready now to link shields with others, to fight this fight, and I'm inviting you to join me.
Now, as you may have noticed, I'm six-feet tall, and when I arrived at my chosen university and realized our men's Division III basketball team averaged five-foot-eight, I abandoned the on-campus scene and went online.
A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA.
Which means I went camping solo in Maine for a week, to do a retro on my track record of mediocre relationships.
So when I went back online in the spring of 2016, I decided to reengineer the process through some classic business tools.
First, I went to OkCupid, because I wanted to avoid the gamification of swipe-based apps.
But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.
After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor, planning to save the world.
Ten years later, I'm a radiation oncologist, fully aware of the suffering caused by tobacco.
And I said, "Option?
Now, I know you can only see one person standing here on this big red dot, on this enormous stage.
And I'm really, really thrilled that after nine years of intense research, as of 2017, we are able to contribute to police investigations.
I believe this is also a new era for criminal profiling.
I'm here to tell you not just my story but stories of exceptional women from India whom I've met.
I was born and brought up in Mumbai.
I went into the villages to work in rural India.
And so in the passion of youth, I married him and left Mumbai, and went to a small village which did not have running water and no toilet.
on the grounds — Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate. I was terrified. I was crying. And by coming back home, I was continuously crying.
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate — to congratulate her.
When I entered the village, I saw a big cutout of Sunita.
I was really surprised to see an untouchable, coming from the village, having a big cutout at the entrance of the village.
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders — men — were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India.
I am just — I couldn't be more proud of her.
20 years before — and I'm so proud — we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank.
Growing up, I was an avid athlete.
My main sport was soccer, and I was a goalkeeper, which is both the best and the worst position on the field.
Just knowing that I was being evaluated changed my performance and forever how I thought about the mental aspect of how we perform.
All of a sudden the ball seemed to go in slow motion, and I was fixated on my every move.
But when I walked into the final, my mind was quiet, and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class.
Now, I'm an artist. And so what happens with me is that when I create something artistically, the trainer in me is awakened as well.
So what I did was, I began to develop that acrostic poem into a full training entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D." Because I remember, being the front-desk specialist, and when I went to the office of equity to start working, I was like, "Is that why they asked us to ask that question?" It all became a bright light to me, and I realized that I asked people and I told people about — I called them by the wrong gender, I called them by the wrong race, I called them by the wrong ethnicity.
I've been obsessed with learning to fly my whole life.
I grew up a feral, adopted child on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, following my bricklayer / fisherman father around.
playing with fire, thrilled and terrified at its unrelenting force, accidentally burning my father's barn down — just once.
I was seized with a compulsion, a primordial urge to learn how to fly, like a human.
When I was 27 years old, I found myself in a rat-infested New York City loft, getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.
I really think it has to do with curiosity and not taking yourself so seriously.
Landing hurts. I was curious, though. I thought, "Well, why don't we invent an impact technique?
I rushed out onto the streets of New York City and went up to complete strangers, and I said — well, I thought — "I did a backfall today. Did you?"
Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the positive response that I received, not only from academia, but also patients, and people around the world affected by this terrible disease.
I recognize that right now, I am on this incredible journey that allows me to pursue work that I am extremely passionate about, and something that feeds my curiosity on a daily basis.
And I am confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt.
Now, you might say, "Oh, you're so lucky." But of course I was lucky, but that luck resulted from a series of small risks I took, starting with saying hello.
I only stayed in the camp for three years, though.
I got enrolled in school.
Education shall be your first husband. "And with these words came in his first big investment. I felt lucky!
I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death.
I came back to the camp to take care of my siblings.
I've never felt so stuck.
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And I'm so proud of that.
These very grounds are where I was born and spent the first seven years of my life.
But I was happy, I was smart, I had friends and above all, I had hope for a brighter future.
I would sometimes get sick with malaria and didn't always know where our next meal would come from.
When we first arrived to the United States and made St. Louis, Missouri home, I remember asking my mom, "Is this really America?" There were things that were sadly familiar, like hearing gunshots at night and the streets looking impoverished.
Like when I started first grade, I noticed how the kids played in groups.
As I grew older, I became more aware of others and how they viewed my race and background.
And I totally get it, my friends, I have also been there.
I started to witness the beginnings of China's green evolution when I was a PhD student conducting fieldwork in China in 2011.
Tam? I have bad news. Keith committed suicide last night. Days later, at his home, I went looking for answers, in his "office" — the garage.
Secretly, I was terrified.
I stayed in my home for a year, thinking I did something wrong, told myself, "What did you do?
I became a high earner, rescuer, and I numbed the pain out with self-help books.
I'm that friend.
Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter for one of the biggest companies in the world.
But after quite a few of these conversations, I've come to a conclusion: I believe that business is in a position to do something that no other entity can do.
As a biologist and a geneticist, it has become my mission to help solve this problem.
I know it sounds nerdy, but you know I'm a scientist.
Do I have postpartum depression? "
I've been building on the anthropology literature and have been talking about matrescence with my patients using a concept called the "push and pull."
I've worked all my life in the field of security and defense, and I am convinced that now, more than ever, we need to radically reframe the way we think and act about security, and especially about international security.
My broken pelvis and I were now facing six weeks on the couch, and I would have gone absolutely insane if it hadn't been for my friends.
That was 21 years ago, and for 19 of those years, I have been married to that marvelous introvert who never in a million years would have approached me under other circumstances.
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion and desires for intimacy that I also carried.
But there is one thing that I knew.
Which meant a greater likelihood to get funded. I was sold.
I was even more horrified to learn — if I could be more horrified — that the oldest of those kits — one of the oldest of those kits — belonged to an eight-year-old girl.
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game, but I also got more risky, started playing in the biggest tournaments I could against the very best in the world.
Growing up in such an environment, I became a strong believer in the power of storytelling.
As I searched for the medium with which to tell my story, I stumbled upon graphic design.
So one day, I walked into one of the biggest libraries in Italy in search of an Arabic book.
But you know, in my situation, and because I was raised to criticize by creating, it's Michelangelos. My father said, "Do not come to me with problems unless you thought of a couple alternatives.
I told you today that someone said to me words that marked me, because I explained the same thing to my employees in Senegal.
But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students.
I of all people know the valuable contributions that whistle-blowers make.
You see, I'm a global solutions director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs.
I could not stop thinking about it. What happens to all these returned clothes? So I came home and researched.
I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this."
I quit, and I went back to grad school to study the effects of this.
Does people's performance really suffer? "I was curious about that, too.
After all, I was the so-called expert there, the former 20-year television news anchor and life and business coach.
Eventually, I stumbled upon a private company to issue a DMCA notice to shut the website down.
The day I ended my silence, I freed myself from shame.
And to get started, I asked myself this one simple question: Who do I need to become now?
It was this toy called a Pleo that I had ordered, and I was really excited about it because I've always loved robots.
And I thought this was super cool, so I was showing it off to my friend.
As both a researcher who studies differences in how individuals' brains wire and rewire themselves, and as a Touretter with other related diagnoses, I have long been fascinated by failures of self-regulation on the impulsive and compulsive behavioral spectrums.
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?
So I was really excited when my mice developed this compulsive behavior, where they were rubbing their faces and they couldn't seem to stop, even when they were wounding themselves.
I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents and we moved to Denmark when I was a young child.
I was elected, but I soon found out that not everyone was happy about it as I had to quickly get used to finding hate messages in my inbox.
Several weeks later I was at a friend's house, and I was very upset and angry about all the hate and racism I had met.
His advice was so unexpected, when I got home, I turned on my computer and opened the folder where I had saved all the hate mail.
When I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me, I was sure that the driver was a racist.
When I got home, I was very ambivalent about my experience.
They have formed me as a democratic citizen and a bridge builder.
Maybe at this point, do you think I am an idealist?
It wasn't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong.
I'm a social scientist.
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators, and I try and understand how beams behave.
When that same person challenged my ideas, it felt terrible, I felt humiliated and ashamed.
In my job as a technology advisor, I've seen so many companies make the well-meaning decisions to put huge investments into technology, only to have the benefits fail to live up to the expectation.
Hello, friends. I'm happy to see all of you here today.
But like all of our friends at the library, I am busy, I lose track of things, my house is sometimes messy, and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa.
I came across this quiet, seemingly abstract painting, and I had to step up to it twice, even three times, to understand why it resonated so deeply.
As a bioethicist, a lawyer, a philosopher and an Iranian-American, I'm deeply concerned about what this means for our freedoms and what kinds of protections we need.
What you're seeing is my brain activity when I was relaxed and curious.
They had big muscles, supermodel good looks, and phenomenal cosmic powers. And me? I kind of looked like this, except shorter and with frizzier hair, and I never felt powerful.
And I'd sit there at my grandmother's dining room table and I'd listen to the women in my family tell these wild, rambunctious tales about navigating their lives in the Bronx.
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft on her own.
I mean, her and Storm even hug. I know. And that's because my mentors loved me enough to encourage me to investigate myself and my ancestors, and when you're 19, how do you even know what that means?
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
Please do not trouble me when I am focused.
I was the first-ever data analyst at Interscope Records.
I been so pressed that I don't even know
The reality is, after soldiering through the Supreme Court nomination process and attacks from the White House, gross mischaracterizations, internet trolls and the rallies and marches and heart-wrenching testimonies, I'm faced with my own hard truth. I'm numb. And I'm not surprised.
I have been propelled by possibility for most of my life.
In 2006, 12 years ago, I laid across a mattress on my floor in my one-bedroom apartment, frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community.
I know some of y'all are tired, because I'm tired.
I'm exhausted, and I'm numb.
When I was in high school at the age of 17 — I graduated from high school in Decatur, Georgia, as valedictorian of my high school — I was very proud of myself.
I was mildly interested in meeting him. It was kind of cool. I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion, because I watched a lot of "General Hospital" and "Dynasty" as a child.
I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community.
Now, you may have heard, I'm in a little bit of debt.
I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke in German when watching "Friends." I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day two more episodes, and as I kept watching, I had more and more of those moments of understanding, these little victories, and step by step, I got to a level where I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything.
I focused on a critical yet largely untapped resource for election modernization: local election officials.
And 10 years ago, I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree.
I am trained to put out many different types of fires.
I am trained to save a life in the moment.
But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction between first responders, the health care community, social services and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.
So a couple of months ago, I walked out on the apparatus floor, where I had some firefighters.
So a couple of weeks ago, I had a neighbor overdose. Twenty-two years old. So of course, I hurried down to help my firefighters and my neighbor.
Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse. And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier.
As a museum curator, I understand why these stories are so seductive.
As an Afro-Latina curator, I'm one of very few.
And I have been tested.
Just last month, I was invited to keynote a Latino Heritage Month event.
That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.
As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative.
When we got to the door, a white man was standing in the doorway with a shotgun, and he said, "Bitch, I'll blow your brains out!" And before I could even react, before I could even process what was going on, Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse, and I fell back, thinking that I was dead.
So deep was my hurt at seeing Tom Coleman murder Jonathan before my eyes, that I became a silent person, and I did not speak for six months.
No, I said, "I'm Canadian."
As a Christian, I believe that God created this incredible planet that we live on and gave us responsibility over every living thing on it.
I'm a Christian, I care about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it, a "threat multiplier." It takes those issues, like poverty and hunger and disease and lack of access to clean water and even political crises that lead to refugee crises — it takes all of these issues and it exacerbates them, it makes them worse.
But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club, I walked in and they had this giant banner that had the Four-Way Test on it. Is it the truth? Absolutely. Is it fair? Heck, no, that's why I care most about climate change, because it is absolutely unfair.
I was giving a talk at a Christian college a number of years ago, and after my talk, a fellow scientist came up and he said, "I need some help.
Growing up, I was very close to my father.
I was very upset. But most of my family members, they were happy with this decision.
I couldn't help her. And I felt so helpless at that time.
So I ran for a public office as an independent candidate in Lower Dir in the local elections in 2001.
Despite all the challenges and hurdles I faced throughout this process, I won.
So when the jury selection process took place, they asked me, "Could you, if the evidence presented justified the death penalty, could you deliver, rationally and without reservations, a penalty of death?" My answer was an astounding "yes," and I was selected as Juror Number 2.
The trial started. From the evidence being presented and from the pictures of the victim, my first response was, "Yes, this man is a monster, and he deserves the death penalty." For days, I sat and looked at his hands, the ones that yielded the knife, and against his pasty white skin, his eyes... Well, he spent endless days in his cell, no sunlight, so his eyes were as black as his hair and his mustache.
He was just a murderer. Get over it. It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor.
And I asked her, "Did that make me a murderer?" She couldn't answer.
So she turned and she looked at her dad, and she said, "Dad, I know how you feel, but I don't believe in the death penalty." My son looked at me, shook his head, and said, "Thanks, Mom." And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."
So: being from a conservative, Christian family from a very conservative state in the United States, I am here to tell you that the death penalty has new opponents.
And I'm sorry, but it doesn't work.
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.
Will I go to college? "And she would reply back," Try to finish high school first. "I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.
I wanted to have a college degree like her, so I fought with my father and my relatives to be sent to college, and it worked.
After many rounds of interviews, I got into the fellowship program with a full scholarship.
Of the 97 fellows selected that year, I was the only rural college graduate.
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.
So I went back to the office, and I told Mr. Ross, "They won't let me make an application." And he said to me, very sternly, "You go right back down to that welfare office, and you demand to see a supervisor.
I went down to the welfare office and I demanded to see the supervisor.
As an undergraduate student, I fell in love with one of them... Mrs. Ples.
I first traveled there in 2003, and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.
But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
So as a classroom teacher, I have to make split-second decisions all the time.
But if a student ever brings something to my attention and I don't know the answer, I will always admit it and own it because I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in something that I don't have experience in or I'm not an authority on.
I was triggered. "And it goes on." Well, what triggered you? "And I go on about how my father was arrested when I was 13, and tortured, all the history... I don't want to get into details now, because you'll start sleeping.
You are an imposter, and we will remove you. "But I was the only known face of the movement. Why? Because I was the only stupid one.
Our vision, or I would say, everyone's vision in Gaza — which I am very privileged to represent the people back home — is to have a good life, a future.
But I'm pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction that is very different from what happened at school.
For example, I know and I feel that as an Asian person, I am less privileged than white people because of white privilege.
