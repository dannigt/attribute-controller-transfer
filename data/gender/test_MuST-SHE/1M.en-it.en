Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences?
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook.
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday — that seemed pretty darn unlikely. But that was a world I could really go to, right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books.
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15.
But I didn't let that daunt me.
And I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo, New York.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives.
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
And even though the film didn't make any money — barely broke even, I should say — I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience, the global audience, was mesmerized by this apparent magic.
And so that got me very excited.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later, I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic, looking at the real Titanic through a view port. Not a movie, not HD — for real. (Applause)
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these expeditions.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well — again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
People sort of think I went away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach.
So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was "Avatar," I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return.
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months.
I fell out of love with this fish. (Laughter) No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie.
I was there not long ago with Miguel.
It's great, but I was in love.
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a — for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back. I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or "American Idol." I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
I wrote the story, I moved on.
I mean, I'm a journalist. We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
I went to prison — difficult.
In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship, I knew I would want to do something a little different.
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. (Laughter) You see, I had this idea for a movie.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. "See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie — and there he is giving me the look he often gave me — he would say," Son, there's three sides to every story. There's your story, there's my story and there's the real story. "Now you see, with this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe. "Isn't that awesome?
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex / death, sex / death, death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts.
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory, just different.
And I grew up in India.
Thanks. I haven't come to the best part.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California — met a lover — and back in the '80s, found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
(Audio) Michael: I'm pretty sure it'll turn out to be asphyxiation.
I was paying close attention earlier, and I now know I need to have 10 hours sleep at night, which is tricky, because last night the show ended about 12: 30, and so I was, I got — and that was in Santa Rosa, so I got home a little late.
It is my belief that when Google came along in 1998, the internet was an open-source, long-tail world with no leader.
But nonetheless, I managed to turn this love of video games into a job, first working on the Game Developers Conference, helping to start the first successful digital distribution company in games, called Trymedia, and then now, writing the Gamification blog.
I'm author of two books on the subject of gamification, including the recent "Gamification by Design," published by O'Reilly.
So when I get invited to an event like this, I'm sure that all of you expect me to get up here and say, "Games are awesome for your children." Right?
Why should I worry?
And maybe I've been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
And I did well, I graduated with honors, cum laude.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation.
And I felt really good.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
But I carried on with my work.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And on a cloudy day, there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered, maybe I could feel better again.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Now I'm an optimist, so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.
Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. (Laughter) If I had really been a egotist, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once, and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this. It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight.' Doesn't that make you feel confident?"
I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
And if that pans out, which I have every confidence it will, Coca-Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African-American home that was dominated by a matriarch, and that matriarch was my grandmother.
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old, waking up one morning, going into the living room, and all of my cousins were running around. And my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me.
I grew up in the country in the rural South, and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger.
Have some beer. "Then he looked at me real hard and he said," Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you. "(Laughter) I said," Well, what are you talking about? "He said," Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special. "(Laughter) I was devastated.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
And because I was up too late, wasn't thinking real straight, I started working on a motion.
A couple months went by, and I had just forgotten all about it. And I finally decided, oh gosh, I've got to go to the court and do this crazy case.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me and he hugged me.
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
I want to talk to you about two of the most exciting possible things. You've probably guessed what they are — data and history. Right? So, I'm not a historian.
I'm influenced as much by the Apple on the right as the next person, but the Apple on the left — I mean, look at that logo!
And with these graphics, I was really interested in the aesthetic of the graphs.
I'm the data artist in residence at the New York Times.
You know, I moved to New York about two years ago.
What am I going to see here? "Well, it turns out, what I saw was that moment I got off the plane to start my new life in New York; the restaurant where I had Thai food that first night, thinking about this new experience of being in New York; the day that I met my girlfriend.
Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story, and then you'll figure it out for yourselves.
First, before I get started, let me be perfectly clear about one thing: my fight is not against the casual adult use of marijuana — I don't care about that.
My addictive use mirrors many of the stories that I'm sure you've heard before.
It started out as fun, it got scary, and then it was just necessary. Enough said. I got wasted for the last time on June 15 of 1996. And I —
Even after all of my work on the front lines and as a former consumer myself, I was shocked and pissed when I started to see what commercialization was doing to cannabis, because, you see, our hope for something pure and natural is making it hard for us to see what's really going on, and that is that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the poor and lying to our faces the entire time.
Ben Cort: I'm actually glad you brought that up.
For me to cast stones — listen, I'm a drug addict.
OK, good, because I'm not alone and I have something to confess; I don't want you guys to judge me.
I was sitting in my car, looking in the rearview mirror, trying to figure out which friend I could call to call in a bomb threat, so I didn't have to go back in the building.
I just left it, I don't want to think about that place again.
That convicted me and so we went outside.
See, I was an artist, so I'd write songs for other artists.
I have become an advocate for stay-at-home parents. Why? Because finally, I was standing in their shoes.
Last month, I went out sailing, and we got out to the Farallon Islands, 25 miles off the Gate.
As a child growing up in Nigeria, books sparked my earliest imagination, but films, films transported me to magical places with flying cars, to infinite space with whole universes of worlds to discover.
My parents definitely were not fans, and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.
Eventually I became a published cartoonist, writing and drawing comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
I taught a little bit of math and a little bit of art, but mostly computer science, and I was there for 17 years.
I was pretty certain that my students would love it, but I was wrong. (Laughter) These video lectures were a disaster.
It was like they liked cartoon me more than actual me. (Laughter) This surprised me, because my students are part of a generation that was raised on screens, so I thought for sure they would like learning from a screen better than learning from a page.
I searched the scientific literature and was surprised to learn that nothing had been published on the public health effects of coal mining in the United States.
I'd been attacked at public testimony at a Congressional hearing by a congressman with ties to the energy industry.
I am an immigrant from Uganda living in the United States while waiting for my asylum application to go through.
So I joined the Environmental Defense Fund to build those kind of solutions.
And it really upset me to think that my race made it harder for them to see me as a student who loved reading, writing and speaking.
Experiences like this motivated me to work tirelessly to disprove what I knew people had assumed.
I was encouraged by my teachers to explore my curiosity, to challenge myself in new ways and to deepen my understanding of subjects that fascinated me the most.
I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors and with outside speakers; to listen, to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself and of others.
I was deeply disappointed by this because, as I saw it, there would be nothing that any of my peers or I could do to silence someone who agreed with him in the office environment of our future employers.
But I did walk away with a deeper understanding.
I see this as an ongoing process involving constant learning, and I'm confident that I'll be able to add value down the line if I continue building empathy and understanding through engaging with unfamiliar perspectives.
CA: You might be the person best placed to answer this question, which has puzzled me, which is to shed light on this strange unit of time called "Elon time." For example, last year, I asked Elon, you know, when Tesla would auto-drive across America, and he said by last December, which is definitely true, if you take Elon time into account.
I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet.
He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
I'm a little bit bigger — I don't like to use the word "fat," but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.
But did our conversation humanize us to each other more than profile pictures and posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there.
DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.
I also want to be super clear about something.
And some have politely declined, others have read my message and ignored it, some have blocked me automatically when I sent the invitation and one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me.
This is an acute question for me, because I'm a prominent advocate of the existence of human nature, with all its shortcomings and perversities.
I'm a first-generation American.
I grew up in New York, which is home to the largest number of immigrants anywhere in the United States.
Junior high school was the first time I went to school with a large number of black American students, and many of them couldn't understand why I sounded differently than they did or why my parents seemed different than theirs.
Remember that. "And he would emphasize this, even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American.
Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work as a digital storyteller that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.
A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am, and I just was not very prudent, this particular video.
So in humans, of course, I am always intrigued by these men who are candidates and hold babies up like this.
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned for his workmanship with steel.
I'd gone to his shed to get some steel edging for the garden.
I myself was one of them, and this is what I talk about at the HALT events, that four years ago when I founded HALT, I didn't know I could go to the doctor about my mental health and get a mental health plan.
For example, I can be a good patriot, loyal to my country, and at the same time, be loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty.
Another technological danger that threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology with biotechnology, which might result in the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself.
But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never underestimate human stupidity.
Chris Anderson: I have been long so fascinated and amazed by so many aspects of Netflix.
And so with Netflix, I was super focused on how to run with no process but not have chaos.
Not me! I'm the child of a missionary, I don't even think about these things. But —
RH: Sure. Right out of college, I was a high school math teacher.
So when I later went into business and became a philanthropist, I think I gravitated towards education and trying to make a difference there.
I'm an MIT professor, but I do not design buildings or computer systems.
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robot, my daughter came downstairs and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg, and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cyborg.
Before my legs were amputated, I was a terrible student.
Then, after my limbs were amputated, I suddenly became an MIT professor.
But you know what, that's OK, because at MIT, I already have tenure.
So I decided to quit my job as a university professor to dedicate my life to save more ocean places like this.
We did an opinion poll on this recently, and I was struck to see that most people actually want us to build superintelligence: AI that's vastly smarter than us in all ways.
And I was actually quite amused to see that there's some some people who want it to be just machines.
Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you to join me in this movement.
For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.
The prescribers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care, probably from pain medicine.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been easy.
To do my part to solve this challenge, in 2012, I moved to a small village in northern Nigeria, in the center of the area most recently hit by the spread of insecurity, brutal bombings and searing poverty, with an idea: Could we create an economic buffer to halt the spread of this insecurity, by unlocking the power of agriculture as a job-creation engine?
In 2001, at the age of 22, I took a job as head of housekeeping at Vundumtiki Camp in the Okavango Delta... a patchwork mosaic of channels, floodplains, lagoons and thousands upon thousands of islands to explore.
As a collector of artifacts and as an artist, I really wanted a Klan robe to be part of my collection, because artifacts and objects tell stories, but I really couldn't find one that was really good quality.
I am a biologist and an engineer who builds stuff out of DNA.
I mean, come on, as a scientist looking for a job, doing cutting-edge research, it doesn't get any better than this.
But for now, I would be satisfied beaming new medicines across the globe, fully automated and on demand, saving lives from emerging infectious diseases and printing personalized cancer medicines for those who don't have time to wait.
I asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
(Video) Hologram: How did I survive?
I survived, I believe, because providence watched over me.
So I set out to see if this could be done and eventually came up with a new solution that can build a model of a person using nothing but these: existing photos and videos of a person.
As a researcher, I'm also working on countermeasure technology, and I'm part of an ongoing effort at AI Foundation, which uses a combination of machine learning and human moderators to detect fake images and videos, fighting against my own work.
But I'm excited and hopeful, because if we use it right and carefully, this tool can allow any individual's positive impact on the world to be massively scaled and really help shape our future the way we want it to be.
I'm an artist. Being an artist is the greatest job there is.
But being an artist is also a daunting job.
So you take a symbol, any symbol, for example the heart and the arrow, which most of us would read as the symbol for love, and I'm an artist, so I can draw this in any given degree of realism or abstraction.
What it takes is actually a very slow, unsexy process of minimal design decisions that then, when I'm lucky, lead to a good idea.
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.
Even as a kid, I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics.
I grew up watching "Star Trek" and "Forbidden Planet," and I saw a UFO once, so this idea of cosmic loneliness I certainly find slightly wistful.
It had more to do with 50, I'm sure, but it has inspired people to think about gardens and sharing each other's worlds in a different way.
Twenty-five years ago, when I was a young pup, very optimistic, we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland, California for the homeless people.
And I was taken by the conceptuality of this kind of digital print that sits in a museum in Charleston.
And I was a prime and willing victim to that type of workaholic thinking.
I moved closer to my mother, my wife usually travels with me, and when my kids have vacation, if they don't come home, I go to them.
I came to talk about first principles and communities that I love — especially East Palo Alto, California, which is full of amazing people.
I nerded on this hard, for years.
And they came to the same conclusion mathematically that I'd come to as an anthropologist, which is: wind and pollution are driving marginalized communities to the east.
I am a visual artist, and I make revolutionary art to propel history forward.
Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity. "" As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass!
I became part of a Supreme Court case when I and others defied that law, by burning flags on the steps of the Capitol.
This is me at the exact same moment, eight stories above that crowd.
I love museums because they're social and educational, but I'm most drawn to them because of the magic of objects: a one-million-year-old hand axe, a totem pole, an impressionist painting all take us beyond our own imaginations.
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and fell in love with the Sonoran Desert's past.
I graduated but wasn't sure what to do next, so I traveled.
In 2007, I was hired as a curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.
This is a medium waiting for its Orson Welles or its Stanley Kubrick, and I have no doubt that they will soon emerge and be recognized as such.
I'm a self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson.
I'll start with a very brief version of how I became a climber, and then tell the story of my two most significant free solos.
After nearly a decade of climbing mostly indoors, I made the transition to the outdoors and gradually started free soloing.
I built up my comfort over time and slowly took on bigger and more challenging walls.
I suddenly decided to skip the hard part and take the variation, even though I'd never climbed it before, but I immediately began to doubt myself.
I'd succeeded in the solo and it was celebrated as a big first in climbing.
Each year, for the next seven years, I'd think, "This is the year that I'm going to solo El Cap." And then I would drive into Yosemite, look up at the wall, and think, "No frickin 'way."
What if I was wasting my time and I would never feel comfortable in such an exposed position?
I felt confident as I looked up the wall.
