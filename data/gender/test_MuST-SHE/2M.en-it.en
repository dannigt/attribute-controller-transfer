His name was Dr. Pizzutillo, an Italian American, whose name, apparently, was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce, so he went by Dr. P. And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.
And, one day, he came in to my session — exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions — and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl, I think you're going to break one of those bands. When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since." (Laughter) (Applause)
I'd like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about, and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words": "Every child has known God, not the God of names, not the God of don'ts, but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them, saying, 'Come dance with me.
Clearly, Patient B suffered more — his colonoscopy was longer, and every minute of pain that Patient A had, Patient B had, and more.
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height?
So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.
I can't, but this guy can. Let's call him Miguel — actually his name is Miguel. (Laughter) And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too.
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes. So, let me give you a little peek. How's that look out there? Pretty good. (Laughs) Yeah, I know. (Laughs) And the people in the back go," OK, I didn't really see that. "People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
There's an economist named Edward Castronova.
And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says — (Laughter) Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. Think about that, it's an incredible fact.
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning, and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease, and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Not long afterwards, a doctor strode into my hospital room, and he said, "Amanda, you'll never walk again." And that was 19 yeas ago.
Up attributes are things like being playful, being fresh like the Fresh Prince, contemporary, adventurous, edgy or daring like Errol Flynn, nimble or agile, profane, domineering, magical or mystical like Gandalf.
I was exposed to him. I have a company that does design and animation, so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world.
Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn't able to communicate it. "
And he's seriously one of the funniest — I call him Yoda, because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him, and you're like, "I'm not worthy.
The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. (Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
Just a week ago, the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper Prize to Francis Arnold and Willem Stemmer, two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way — what Frances Arnold calls "directed evolution." A couple of years ago, the Lasker Prize was awarded to the scientist Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell, a fibroblast, and by manipulating just four genes, he induced that cell to revert to a pluripotential stem cell — a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body.
Why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings, especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine?
Now if you take this picture — I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom — but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment.
We've been working with Roberto Bolle, one of today's top ballet dancers — the étoile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan — and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire.
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old, who was born a boy, raised a boy, had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend, had a life as a guy, and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.
And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because he's actually any different in age, biologically, except in terms of when he was born.
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy, Doctor Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with — a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
A friend of mine did that — Richard Bollingbroke.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
He had an encounter with a man behind him, and as you can see, the man behind him has covered his face with a balaclava.
But I can tell you now, he was PC Simon Harwood, a police officer with London's Metropolitan Police Force.
Now, this does not show the attack on Ian Tomlinson, but he appears to be in some distress. Was he drunk? Did he fall over? Did this have anything to do with the police officers next to him?
But he was a political refugee from Angola.
He'd become unwell on the flight, the plane had returned to Heathrow, and then he was transferred to hospital and pronounced dead.
Now, what actually happened to Jimmy Mubenga, the story we were able to tell, my colleague Mathew Taylor and I, was that, actually, three security guards began trying to restrain him in his seat; when was resisting his deportation, they were restraining him in his seat.
This was Michael. He was on an Angolan oil field when he sent me this tweet.
He had concerns about what happened on the flight.
He'd gone onto his laptop, he typed in the flight number.
She trotted out researchers like Doctor Christopher Lucas at NYU, who said games don't teach the right kind of attention skills where kids have sustained attention, where they're not receiving regular rewards.
So as an adult, he went back and got a master's in [Education] and took over a class at White Bear Lake Elementary School.
Do we have women as victims, and are men only the perpetrators?
And I asked last week, in a meeting with Dutch government representatives, I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack.
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager, and I asked the manager, "Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?" And he pointed to the busloads of tourists that would show up everyday, with cameras ready usually.
He was the sonar engineer working for the Navy.
So he wrote a letter to the mathematician in the middle, a young mathematician in California at the time, Solomon Golomb.
He's famous because he invented a whole branch of mathematics which bears his name, called Galois field theory.
He's also famous because of the way that he died.
He was challenged to a duel, and he accepted.
And shortly before the duel occurred, he wrote down all of his mathematical ideas, sent letters to all of his friends, saying "Please, please" — this was 200 years ago — "Please, please, see that these things get published eventually." He then fought the duel, was shot and died at age 20.
His goal as a composer was to write music that would free music from tonal structure.
Unfortunately, he died 10 years before Costas solved the problem of how you can mathematically create these structures.
I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do, which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself.
And he knew her, he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients without even having to contact him.
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way.
And she said the three words: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?" Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.
And fortunately he didn't die.
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days.
My name is Brian Goldman. I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well, so he can see what's my problem in weight, not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it, but also looking backward.
Back then, when Arjuna, the great Indian warrior prince, when he was thirsty, he'd take out a bow, he'd shoot it into the ground and water would come out.
He is a poet, a playwright, a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
At midnight, the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.
She asked the monk, "Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?" "Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said. "You have not let it go."
Given who we were and how life had shaped us, we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives would have thwarted us.
Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law, and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months.
And the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the great DIY innovators, I'd like to share with you — he gave me permission to do so — his technology called Slingshot that many of you may have heard of, it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator.
Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this. He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression, we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, an orientation of the spirit, a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness."
And the judge has certified him as an adult, but I see this kid.
And I started working on this motion, and the head of the motion was: "Motion to try my poor, 14-year-old black male client like a privileged, white 75-year-old corporate executive."
And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
And he whispered in my ear. He said, "I'm so proud of you." And I have to tell you, it was energizing.
Well I went into the courtroom. And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" I said, "Yes, sir.
Well I went into the courtroom. And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in. He said, "Mr. Stevenson, did you write this crazy motion?" I said, "Yes, sir.
And this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
So he did what any good developer would do, he wrote an app.
There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it, not for snow, but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.
Like anybody my age who works creatively with computers, I was a popular, socially well-adjusted young man —
And sporty! Sporty young man. And like a lot of people my age in the type of business that I'm in, I was influenced tremendously by Apple.
And sporty! Sporty young man. And like a lot of people my age in the type of business that I'm in, I was influenced tremendously by Apple.
The first one, I've been working on in conjunction with Mark Hansen. Mark Hansen is a professor of statistics at UCLA.
But second of all, both of these guys are software designers.
But Chopin, another clever entrepreneur — you know what he does?
10: 00: New Life This quest has changed the hero; he has outgrown his old life.
The German physicist Werner Heisenberg said, "When I meet God, I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first."
In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode.
Sixty years later, Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to the 5 / 3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics.
While it's too easy to say Van Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately express the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely difficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries of movement, fluid and light.
At the end of the experiment, he was struggling to concentrate, had trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating.
In fact, I was recently talking to a buddy who had just left a job at a commercial grow operation because he was so concerned with the chemicals that he was being asked to interact with.
And my newborn was in the bassinet, crying, tears running down his face.
I was talking to a friend of mine, he said, "Man, I come home from work, drawers are open, clothes hanging outside the drawers, the kids are still in their pajamas... And it can't be that hard to have dinner ready when I get home, right?"
And Dr. Sylvia Earl has been influential, like John Muir, with administrations — George W. Bush and Obama were both fantastic ocean presidents, creating marine protected areas all around the country.
My friend Erik and I started building underwater robots, these little swimming cameras with lights that you can see underwater.
I had students coming up to me and saying things like, "Mr. Yang, we thought you were boring in person, but on video, you are just unbearable." (Laughter) So as a desperate second attempt, I began drawing these lectures as comics.
This is child psychologist Dr. Fredric Wertham, and in 1954, he wrote a book called "Seduction of the Innocent," where he argues that comic books cause juvenile delinquency. (Laughter)
Now, Dr. Wertham was actually a pretty decent guy.
Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues, uses Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" in his literature and film class, because that book gives his students the language with which to discuss the relationship between words and images.
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood what the client wanted.
But the funny thing about Adam Smith is that he was a stay-at-home kind of guy.
And fortunately, there's actually an easy answer, because the Arab lawyer and traveler Ibn Battuta traveled down the east coast of Africa in the 14th century, and what he found when he got to Mogadishu was a market, and he wrote about it.
The fool can't even separate his recycling. "But the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is that it does work.
You be the judge. The professor in this famous scene, he's welcoming the new 1L class, and he says, "Look to your left.
One governor has publicly declared that he refuses to read the research.
And I suppose I could mention from one of the very earliest computer scientists, whose name was Norbert Wiener, and he wrote a book back in the '50s, from before I was even born, called "The Human Use of Human Beings." And in the book, he described the potential to create a computer system that would be gathering data from people and providing feedback to those people in real time in order to put them kind of partially, statistically, in a Skinner box, in a behaviorist system, and he has this amazing line where he says, one could imagine, as a thought experiment — and I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a quote — one could imagine a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on what they did, and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior modification.
Now, this little boy here, Pamelo, from Zambia, he has trachoma.
In fact, President Carter, he talks about how trachoma was a real problem in Georgia when he was a little boy.
But before I finish, I just want to share with you some words from the founder of Sightsavers, a guy called Sir John Wilson.
Now, he was blinded at the age of 12.
First, let me introduce myself, I'm Fred, I've been an environmentalist since I was a kid, when I watched the fish and the frogs in my neighborhood pond die from a chemical spill. That bothered me. Later, a professor inspired me to think about environmentalism differently.
He then got what he was reaching for, whatever she was blocking, and went on his merry way.
But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck." It's a slur, short for "cuckold," for men who have been cheated on by their wives.
Because some of the hate I received was from "my side." So when Matthew, a queer liberal artist like me publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism, I wanted to ask him this.
It happened when feudal Europe was brought under the control of centralized kingdoms, so that today a Western European has 1 / 35th the chance of being murdered compared to his medieval ancestors.
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell, a Government of Canada scientist, has been studying a type of algae that grows on rocks.
The problem was, Dr. Bothwell wasn't allowed to speak to the reporter, because the government of the day wouldn't let him.
One government scientist, a friend of mine, we'll call him McPherson, was concerned about the impact government policies were having on his research and the state of science deteriorating in Canada.
He was so concerned, he wrote to me from his wife's email account because he was afraid a phone call could be traced.
I listened and I shared what I learned with my friend in Parliament, a man who was interested in all things environment, science, technology, innovation.
He came for school, earning his bachelor's degree in accounting and eventually became an accountant.
And as an example, I want to give you Amos, a male that I knew who was a young male and he was alpha male, he was very popular, but he got sick and he lost his position because, you know, chimpanzee males they can spot from a mile away if you are weak and they went for him, and he lost his position, and then he got sicker and sicker until at some point we had to isolate him.
He was loved and respected, and everyone was taking care of him, and this is not always how it goes, because some males don't end so well when they lose their position.
The other male is pant-grunting to him, is being submissive to him and bowing for him, and that is the sort of ritual they need to go through many times a day in order to have a stable relationship.
The male whom he is grooming on the side is twice as old, and this old male has made him the leader.
So in humans, of course, I am always intrigued by these men who are candidates and hold babies up like this.
If you don't do that, that old male is going to get mad at you, and you're going to lose him as a partner.
But the perpetrator's lawyer made sure the jury knew about those orgasms because he thought the orgasms could be construed as consent.
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned for his workmanship with steel.
And invariably at every single HALT event at a hardware store, I have one tradie come up to me, at least one come up and tell me about his suicide attempt.
And it's not just they talk to me and tell me their story, they actually now say, "We feel comfortable enough to talk with other men." I've had men stand up and say, "I've never mentioned before that I've had depression, but I have, and if anyone else here wants to come and speak to me, I'm here to talk to you." It's very empowering and cathartic to do that.
A dictator may not be able to provide me with good health care, but he will be able to make me love him and to make me hate the opposition.
Now, today my identity quest is no longer to find my tribe. It's more about allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating diversity within me and not just around me. My boys now are three years and five months old today, and they were already born with three nationalities and four languages.
Jim Ewing fell to earth and was badly broken, but his eyes turned skyward, where he always longed to return.
Using this technology, Jim returned to the Cayman Islands, the site of his accident, rebuilt as a cyborg to climb skyward once again.
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher, and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.
So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove.
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you to join me in this movement.
Here is a little cute guy developed at Harvard University, and he walks thanks to waves of pressure applied along its body, and thanks to the flexibility, he can also sneak under a low bridge, keep walking, and then keep walking a little bit different afterwards.
I want to tell you about Omar, a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy who arrived to the shore on Lesbos on a crowded rubber boat.
Crying, frightened, unable to understand what's happening to him, he was right on the verge of developing a new trauma.
Sadiye got back on the phone with the prescriber and this time he recommended that we contact our pain management team from the last hospitalization.
Furious, we called the prescriber back and begged him for anything — anything that could help me — but instead he apologized, saying that he was out of his depth. "Look," he told us, "my initial advice to you is clearly bad, so my official recommendation is that Travis go back on the medication until he can find someone more competent to wean him off." Of course I wanted to go back on the medication.
Despite this beauty, Saminu knew that the first chance he got, he would leave.
He did not want to be a farmer.
Angry, these young men set out to wreak vengeance on a society that they believed had turned its back on them.
Imagine a world where millions of young men across Africa, hardworking young men, have other options.
I know these driven, ambitious young men will make the right choice.
And so a young scientist that I was working with at the time, Rob Olson, was able to take this thing apart, put it on a ship, put it back together and take it off to sea. And it worked like a charm. We didn't think it would, because we thought the ship's vibrations would get in the way of the focusing of the laser, but it really worked like a charm.
In March of 2006, police interrogated Brendan Dassey, a 16-year-old high school student with an IQ around 70, putting him in the range of intellectual disability.
Lindsay Malloy: They told Brendan that honesty would "set him free," but they were completely convinced of his guilt at that point.
So by honesty, they meant a confession, and his confession would definitely not end up setting him free.
It was nothing more than his own words that sent him to prison for nearly a decade, until a judge overturned his conviction just a few months ago.
And Trevor was actually a little upset that you knew about his binges, because even though he'd been the one to connect the TV to the router, he forgot that the TV was watching us.
By the way, here's Richard Feynman, who in addition to being a Nobel Prize winner in physics was also known as a legendary teacher.
Together with my friend in adventure, Richard Rogers, we were, at the time, young bad boys.
We had the design, we went to the then-mayor and said, "Mr. Mayor, it's only going to cost you 1.1 million dollars." And he looked at me. "For homeless people?" And he didn't give us the money.
My father had passed away, and I never had a chance to tell him I loved him.
The police is targeting three suspects, having narrowed down the search from over 20 men who had been seen in that area on the same day.
We passed this information to the police, and they found out that, actually, Thomson is a drug addict, and he also has a medical record for psychotic episodes, for which presumably the antidepressant was prescribed.
On the same line, I ended up in a very small village, fell in love with a young, handsome, dynamic young farmer-leader who was not very educated, but he could pull the crowd.
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders — men — were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India.
Robert became fearful and withdrawn.
A scientist in my lab developed a new way to analyze DNA with computers, and he discovered something very surprising.
In the last year, a Jean-Michel Basquiat sold for 110 million dollars, the highest price ever achieved for the work of an American artist, and a painting by Leonardo da Vinci sold for 450 million, setting a new auction record.
And my father, who had been absent in most of my early childhood, was doing what other men were doing: fighting for the country.
My father, on the other hand, was rich. He had many cows.
But he, too, joined the list of the dead.
I think you do have too much trouble about this flag. "" I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage, i.e., the jungles of Africa, and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way. "" This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system: the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world, including my brother who was shot by a pig, who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.' That pig was wearing the flag.
This is a medium waiting for its Orson Welles or its Stanley Kubrick, and I have no doubt that they will soon emerge and be recognized as such.
Lucius, who awoke at dawn, has family duties to perform today. (Cheering) His 15-year-old brother is coming of age.
The bulla had worked. It had protected him. Unlike many others, he had survived to become an adult.
This takes them ten minutes since the janitor has to slow down for the old professor who keeps muttering that he probably shouldn't have given the zombies night vision.
The tallest captive sees three black hats in front of him, so he says "black," telling everyone else he sees an odd number of black hats.
Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be one of the black hats the first two prisoners saw.
The first prisoner has a 50% chance of giving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else to guess theirs with absolute certainty.
Gender and age affect this repair mechanism, which is why young men with more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game.
Dr. Covinsky, a clinical researcher at the University of California, he concludes that a third of patients over 70 and more than half of patients over 85, leave the hospital more disabled than when they came in.
A friend of mine, Art, he recently needed to be hospitalized for just a minor surgery, and he had to stay in the hospital for over two weeks, just because he needed a specific kind of IV antibiotics.
It was heartbreaking to see my dad, this strong, athletic, energetic guy, lying in the bed with electrodes strapped to his bare chest.
What put him there was work-related stress.
Steve, a physician, told me about a doctor that he worked with who was never very respectful, especially to junior staff and nurses.
Within five years, Doug had turned things around.
How did he do it?
My manipulative, jealous, stalker ex-boyfriend did exactly what he said he would do: he put up a website with my name on it, and he posted this. And this. And several explicit photos that he had taken of me while I was asleep, living with him in Jamaica.
But then something happened. Jamaican authorities actually arrested him.
The day I ended my silence, I freed myself from shame. And I freed myself from the fear of judgment from the one person who I thought would judge me the most — my son, who actually told me, "Mom, you are the strongest person that I know. You can get through this. And besides, mom — he chose the wrong woman to mess with."
