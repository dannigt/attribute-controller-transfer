I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
You know, I was a real science geek.
And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives.
But when I chose a career as an adult, it was filmmaking.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these expeditions.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-human futures that I can imagine, as a science fiction fan.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well — again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems. And this was fascinating. But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
It's great, but I was in love.
I was totally confused.
We're not realists, us foodies; we're lovers.
And if I'm going to be really honest, they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a — for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician. Thank you. (Applause)
I don't know. I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous. It's because possibilities on this planet, they don't go back, they go forward.
I mean, I'm a journalist. We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
I remember my first fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.
Well, I was next.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
We want you to tell a story, but we just want to tell our story. "See, when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie — and there he is giving me the look he often gave me — he would say," Son, there's three sides to every story.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
Remember, it's free; none of us are making any money on this thing.
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
That makes me feel very good as a doctor.
We have been here for about 130,000 years.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I call it neo-evolution — the new evolution that is not simply natural, but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make.
Or, will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us? Will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform, or more robust and more versatile?
And here was myself trying not to get wet, testing the sensors that open the water.
And that was, for us, was very interesting, because, as architects, as engineers, as designers, we always think about how people will use the things we design.
The leader of the congress came up on stage and said, "Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture, but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
My circle began back in the '60s in high school in Stow, Ohio where I was the class queer.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
The result was putting out stories ourselves.
Individuals with material that could help us were drawn toward us by some kind of gravitational force.
I had spoken to so many people who said they had seen this happen, and the guy on the other end of the phone was saying, "Look, the video shows it." I didn't want to believe him until I saw it for myself.
(Audio) Michael: I'm pretty sure it'll turn out to be asphyxiation.
I was not a serious participant, but I was following along closely from the start, and it was just amazing.
And today, I'm very pleased to say, as a result, you can go online — anybody here — and download the human genome.
I'm author of two books on the subject of gamification, including the recent "Gamification by Design," published by O'Reilly.
So when I get invited to an event like this, I'm sure that all of you expect me to get up here and say, "Games are awesome for your children." Right?
Because I'm a games guy and this is how I make my living. (Applause)
Now, when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be, "OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me, because I'm a legal citizen.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn't get sued.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work. And then it happened again.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry. He kept pointing here.
I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
Now when I was a kid growing up, the future was kind of the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it.
I already had a profession as a teacher, but I went ahead anyway and sent an email off to the program, explaining that I was a teacher of the deaf, wondering if I could take a few classes with them and perhaps share their lessons with my students.
Hi. I'm Kevin Allocca, I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
Have some beer." Then he looked at me real hard and he said, "Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you." (Laughter) I said, "Well, what are you talking about?" He said, "Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special." (Laughter) I was devastated.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
I think if somebody tells a lie, they're not just a liar.
I do get tired, as we all do.
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking, well gosh, if the judge can turn you into something that you're not, the judge must have magic power.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me and he hugged me.
And people started coming in because they were just outraged. I had written these crazy things.
I'm influenced as much by the Apple on the right as the next person, but the Apple on the left — I mean, look at that logo!
And with these graphics, I was really interested in the aesthetic of the graphs.
I'm the data artist in residence at the New York Times.
This was the first title I thought of for this talk, "Beethoven as Bill Gates." Does that make sense? Maybe not. OK, so think about that. Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story, and then you'll figure it out for yourselves.
I'm a physicist by training.
And when it stops swimming, that's depression. OK? And I'm from theoretical physics, so I'm used to people making very sophisticated mathematical models to precisely describe physical phenomena, so when I saw that this is the model for depression, I though to myself, "Oh my God, we have a lot of work to do."
Even after all of my work on the front lines and as a former consumer myself, I was shocked and pissed when I started to see what commercialization was doing to cannabis, because, you see, our hope for something pure and natural is making it hard for us to see what's really going on, and that is that the rich are getting richer on the backs of the poor and lying to our faces the entire time.
For me to cast stones — listen, I'm a drug addict.
OK, good, because I'm not alone and I have something to confess; I don't want you guys to judge me. This feels like a safe space, is it a safe space?
I was sitting in my car, looking in the rearview mirror, trying to figure out which friend I could call to call in a bomb threat, so I didn't have to go back in the building.
So, I had issues with this, because I haven't seen a lot of stay-at-home dads before and I thought men would judge me, so get this, I said this — please don't be offended — I said, "Uh, you know,
I looked at myself in the mirror, and I said... "Which friend can you call to call in a bomb threat?
You know what else I thought as a stay-at-home parent?
I have become an advocate for stay-at-home parents. Why? Because finally, I was standing in their shoes.
As a child growing up in Nigeria, books sparked my earliest imagination, but films, films transported me to magical places with flying cars, to infinite space with whole universes of worlds to discover.
I became a voracious comic book reader, but I never brought them to school.
My parents definitely were not fans, and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.
Eventually I became a published cartoonist, writing and drawing comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
When I was a brand new teacher, I tried bringing comic books into my classroom.
My students didn't think I was cool. They thought I was kind of a dork.
But again, I was wrong.
A few years into my teaching career, I learned firsthand the educational potential of comics.
At the time, I was also the school's educational technologist, which meant every couple of weeks I had to miss one or two periods of this Algebra 2 class because I was in another classroom helping another teacher with a computer-related activity.
I was pretty certain that my students would love it, but I was wrong.
And I was so intrigued by this experience that I had with these comics lectures that I decided to focus my final master's project on comics.
And I'm sure we'd all be pretty sad to see that.
I'd been attacked at public testimony at a Congressional hearing by a congressman with ties to the energy industry.
Making revelations of space is what I do; I'm a designer and creative director, and that's what I do for a living.
I mean, I'm sure I was thinking, "The drainage needs to be designed in this parking lot." But then I was like, "Everything in the world needs to be designed." And it's true: left to its own devices, Mother Nature isn't going to carve an interesting or necessarily helpful path for you.
I'm certain it's possible.
And I'm certain that the companies, the Googles and the Facebooks, would actually do better in this world.
I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet.
He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
I'm a little bit bigger — I don't like to use the word "fat," but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.
DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.
I also want to be super clear about something.
This is an acute question for me, because I'm a prominent advocate of the existence of human nature, with all its shortcomings and perversities.
I'm a first-generation American.
Are you even black? a student asked.
I mean, I thought I was black.
But he would say, "But you're African. Remember that." And he would emphasize this, even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American.
Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work as a digital storyteller that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.
Every summer when I was growing up, I would fly from my home in Canada to visit my grandparents, who lived in Mumbai, India.
So, while I'm very excited about all we can do for cooling, and I think there's a lot yet to be done, as a scientist, I'm also drawn to a more profound opportunity that I believe this work highlights.
We do like to shorten things in the Australian vernacular. A tradie. There was an expectation as a tradie.
That was the epiphany. That was the moment where I was standing in a community hall in a place where this Castlemaine community had given me such support for 20 years, this community had backed my work, I'd played footy there, I'd done theater there, I was so grateful for what they'd given me.
Yet because of my tradie culture and that ignorant attitude that we have in the tradie community, I didn't feel confident at all.
Tradies especially, and I'm a tradie myself, we love egg and bacon rolls.
I myself was one of them, and this is what I talk about at the HALT events, that four years ago when I founded HALT, I didn't know I could go to the doctor about my mental health and get a mental health plan.
For example, I can be a good patriot, loyal to my country, and at the same time, be loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty.
Another technological danger that threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology with biotechnology, which might result in the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself.
As for the rest of us who are not engineers, the number one question facing us is how not to allow ourselves to be manipulated by those who control the data.
But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never underestimate human stupidity. (Laughter) (Applause) It is one of the most powerful forces that shape history.
I have done a lot of this myself, and I still think it's amazing it's even possible.
Not me! I'm the child of a missionary, I don't even think about these things. But —
RH: Sure. Right out of college, I was a high school math teacher.
So when I later went into business and became a philanthropist, I think I gravitated towards education and trying to make a difference there.
I'm an MIT professor, but I do not design buildings or computer systems.
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robot, my daughter came downstairs and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg, and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cyborg.
Before my legs were amputated, I was a terrible student.
Then, after my limbs were amputated, I suddenly became an MIT professor.
And storytelling is much like what's happening right now: I'm standing up here, the unitary authority, and I am talking to you. And you are sitting back, and you are receiving what I have to say.
And you may disagree with it, you may think I'm an insufferable fool, you may be bored to death, but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head.
And I'm incredibly proud of that.
So I decided to quit my job as a university professor to dedicate my life to save more ocean places like this.
Each told beautiful stories of Amy and of us.
The scope of Amy's impact was deeper and richer than even us and her family knew.
Some of the responses I received helped me with the intense grieving process because of their humor, like this email I received from a woman reader who read the article, declaring, "I will marry you when you are ready — (Laughter)
In the early months following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming.
Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me.
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove, but I want you to join me in this movement.
As a biologist, I'm still trying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other, who is related to whom.
For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.
I'm James. I'm a writer and artist, and I make work about technology.
I make things like neural networks that predict the results of elections based on weather reports, because I'm intrigued about what the actual possibilities of these weird new technologies are.
I'm convinced that we can build cities of difference that help to create the global mosaic to which so many of us aspire.
Even today, there are over one billion people living in poor, rural communities around the world that do not have safe, year-round access to the things that you and I take for granted: education, medical care, access to markets... which is why wonderful organizations like Bridges to Prosperity build bridges in this kind of place — this is in Rwanda.
And yet of course they want innovation. Innovation is vital. As an engineer, it's part of my DNA.
I couldn't be a very good engineer if I wasn't wanting to innovate, but we have to do so from a position of knowledge and strength and understanding.
Because if the symptoms didn't kill me outright, I'd kill myself.
But I believed it to my core because I no longer had any hope that I would be normal again.
The prescribers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care, probably from pain medicine.
Growing up, he saw his parents work so hard as farmers, but barely get by.
In 2001, at the age of 22, I took a job as head of housekeeping at Vundumtiki Camp in the Okavango Delta... a patchwork mosaic of channels, floodplains, lagoons and thousands upon thousands of islands to explore.
This is a mass drowning of 15,000 wildebeests that I witnessed in the Maasai Mara two years ago.
I am a product of the American tech industry, both as a consumer and a corporate leader.
So I am well acquainted with this type of fuel.
I am a biologist and an engineer who builds stuff out of DNA.
I mean, come on, as a scientist looking for a job, doing cutting-edge research, it doesn't get any better than this.
Like an author of a book, this started out as writing short sentences, or sequences of DNA code, but this soon turned into writing paragraphs and then full-on novels of DNA code, to make important biological instructions for proteins and living cells.
As a researcher, I'm also working on countermeasure technology, and I'm part of an ongoing effort at AI Foundation, which uses a combination of machine learning and human moderators to detect fake images and videos, fighting against my own work.
But I'm excited and hopeful, because if we use it right and carefully, this tool can allow any individual's positive impact on the world to be massively scaled and really help shape our future the way we want it to be.
I can have more fun. But of course, I know that eventually things become so obscure that I start losing some of you. So as a designer, it's absolutely key to have a good understanding of the visual and cultural vocabulary of your audience.
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.
Even as a kid, I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics.
You know, as an architect, at 10 o ’ clock in the morning, you need to be a poet, for sure.
(Laughter) I'm Italian, and I love beauty. I love beauty. Well, let's go sailing, I want to take you sailing here, to this place, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
As an educator, designer, I'd like to share with you five simple concepts that I've developed through my work.
Twenty-five years ago, when I was a young pup, very optimistic, we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland, California for the homeless people.
And I was a prime and willing victim to that type of workaholic thinking. I worked incredibly hard. That's why I almost left my wife in the delivery room, that's why I worked 996 alongside my entrepreneurs. And that obsession that I had with work ended abruptly a few years ago when I was diagnosed with fourth stage lymphoma.
And they came to the same conclusion mathematically that I'd come to as an anthropologist, which is: wind and pollution are driving marginalized communities to the east.
Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity. "" As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass!
This is me at the exact same moment, eight stories above that crowd.
As a musician and an engineer, and someone raised in a family of artists, I thought that this idea of musical photographs was really powerful.
But for AIVA, this process is taken from years and years of learning, decades of learning as an artist, as a musician and a composer, down to a couple of hours.
And I couldn't be more proud to show it to you, so if you can, close your eyes and enjoy the music.
I'm sure there's a hundred better ones right here in this room.
A confession: I am an archaeologist and a museum curator, but a paradoxical one.
As a college student, all of this was an enigma that was hard to decipher. Why did Native Americans want their heritage back from the very places preserving it?
I'm no Mandela, but I ask myself: Could I, too, plant seeds of hope in the ruins of the past?
In 2007, I was hired as a curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
Just the two of us you see And nothing more
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
So that gives you an idea of what my work is about as an interactive writer.
Where a linear writer needs to deal with time and space, as an interactive writer, I need to deal with time, space and possibilities.
I am convinced that in the coming years, we will see more and more moving and meaningful interactive experiences, created by a new generation of talents.
I love infographics. As an information designer, I've worked with all sorts of data over the past 25 years.
When eventually I was persuaded to go, the optometrist fitted me with the trial lenses and was shocked at just how poor my sight was.
I went from a failing child at school who was constantly told I was lazy and not paying attention to suddenly being a child with opportunity and potential.
This deep sense of injustice drove me to become a doctor, eventually an eye surgeon, and in 2012, my wife and I packed our bags and moved to Kenya to try and give something back.
Inspired by the challenges I'd had as a child, we equipped teachers, 25 of them, with smartphones to screen children in schools.
We've had incredible commitments of 200 million pairs of glasses to the fund and millions of dollars, so that the dynamic and individual needs of people — like my own issues that I had as child, and like Theresa, who just required simple surgery — can be met.
4.5 billion drug prescriptions will be prescribed by doctors like me this year, in the United States alone. That's 15 for every man, woman and child.
I mean, these political movements have built their success with ideas that could mean, down the road, losing my French citizenship because I'm North African or not being able to come back home to the US because I come from a Muslim-majority country.
It showed another fascinating finding: 71 percent of the world population agreed with the statement, "I am a citizen of the world." Do you know what it means?
I'd been brought in to the company because I was a seasoned expert in my field, but in this particular room, I felt like a newbie amongst the tech geniuses.
I just sat there awkwardly, and mercifully, he moved on to someone else.
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat, so she often sat right next to me in meetings so she could be my tech translator, and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means." Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.
At Airbnb, I also learned as a modern elder that my role was to intern publicly and mentor privately.
I was slightly rattled, I was pretty rattled, but I tried not to let it bother me too much because I knew that all the hardest climbing was up at the top.
This time I popped over the edge shirtless, panting, jacked.
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye.
I looked like a lost hiker that was too close to the edge. I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics.
We spent the day climbing together to a specific crack in the middle of the wall that was choked with loose rocks that made that section difficult and potentially dangerous, because any missed step might knock a rock to the ground and kill a passing climber or hiker.
Basically, I was ready.
I felt confident as I looked up the wall.
Now, when I tell people I'm an astrophysicist, they're usually pretty impressed.
And then I say I'm also a musician — they're like, "Yeah, we know."
I was the navigator on board, and one evening, after a long session analyzing weather data and plotting our course, I came up on deck and saw this beautiful sunset.
We have been called the Indians
We have been called Native American
We have been called pagan
What? Dude, no, I'm just making slides. I'm a consultant. I make slides. I'm making PowerPoint slides, I'm not looking —
As a new parent, I tell you, I am troubled by devastating images of young children being ripped out of the arms of their parents at the US border and being placed in private detention facilities that did too little to help the kids maintain contact with their parents.
The result is important, but whatever happens, I'm pretty sure it will be followed by many other similar proposals around the world.
During my daily regular job as a web developer, I didn't have the feeling that I'm working on something that had a chance to be a bigger than me.
So in 2005, I was a development executive at Leonardo's production company.
Surely, there was some unwritten Hollywood rule of omertà that had guided people away from doing that before that I was simply too naive to understand, it being so early in my career.
I was sure I was going to get fired, and so I decided that day that A: I would never tell anybody that I had done this, and B: I would never do it again.
That our onscreen heroes have to conform to a very narrow idea about beauty that we consider conventional. What does that mean when those images are projected 30 feet high and the lights go down, for a kid that looks like me in Columbus, Georgia? Or a Muslim girl in Cardiff, Wales?
I was fascinated by this weird conception: viruses curing an infection.
To this day, I am fascinated by the medical potential of phages.
Well, we weren't as smart as we thought we were.
A number of clinical trials are getting underway in Europe and the US. So I'm convinced that we're standing on the verge of a renaissance of phage therapy.
That's an interesting idea. "(Laughter) Now I'm a writer, and for my books I like to go on adventures.
Because I am terrified. "But we made it. And I met the farmers, the Guarnizo brothers.
I'm still a selfish bastard a huge amount of the time. But I'm better than I was before this project.
Or that's what she said, she was really proud of me — and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage; I was picking and packing, doing all the work, but then I graduated to actually managing the people who picked and packed, and then pretty soon I managed the people who managed the people picking and packing.
So I told you. But I really was conflicted, right?
There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley that says, "Let's celebrate failure." No, I don't know if we would go all the way there, because like, in our board meetings, our board members are never like, "Hey, Chieh, you failed last quarter, keep doing that, buddy, OK?" No one's ever said that.
I don't know about you, but when I was little, story time was always one of my favorite parts of the day.
I was dishonest, and I paid the penalty.
Before that, I'd been a practicing solicitor for 30 years.
Please, don't leave. Join us. We may not be perfect, but whatever happens, at least you won't be alone.
Indeed, I'm a university professor.
I'm a meteorologist by degree, I have a bachelor's, master's and PhD in physical meteorology, so I'm a meteorologist, card carrying.
But admittedly, I'm a weather geek.
Are you only looking for information to support what you already think? "And if I was honest with myself, and I tried to be
Maybe there was still a doubt as to how much, but to say "nothing" was not a responsible thing for me to do as a scientist or a person.
Personally, I'm taking all of this as a call to be the ally who, like my boss did for me, lets people know that it's OK to open up.
Bertha, Eldra Jr., Taydama and Eldra III. That's me. My father was a Vietnam veteran who earned a Purple Heart and made it home to find love, marry, and begin his own brood.
One of the best things that happened in my life to that point was being sent to New Folsom Prison.
I was accompanied by skilled facilitators on a journey into the depths of myself to find those wounded parts that not only festered but seeped out to create unsafe space for others.
I stand here today for the first time since I was 14 years old not under any form of state supervision. I'm married to a tremendous woman named Holly, and together, we are raising two sons who I encourage to experience emotions in a safe way.
So, I'm a climate scientist, and if this room is representative of the country we live in, that means about 60 percent of you, so maybe from about there over, don't strongly trust me for information on the causes of climate change.
And in fact, as a scientist, I can tell you there is no way you could get away with that kind of antic today.
I was in awe of her focus and determination to succeed at whatever she loved to do.
I showed her what to do by acting out the scenarios myself.
This painting is called "The Dressmaker." I remember, as a kid, Mom sewing clothes for the whole family on this massive, heavy sewing machine that was bolted to the floor in the basement.
Her call clarified what I am trying to do with my life and in my work as a writer, which is to send one simple message: the way we're taught to live has got to change.
It felt as out of the blue to me then as it may to you now.
I was prominent for a 24-year-old: intelligent, I spoke well, dressed decent; I was an upstanding citizen.
I had achieved, by my late 20s, about everything a kid is supposed to achieve.
I like to think of this great man when he's tired, he's stressed, he's anxious about the reception of his book "The Descent of Man." You or I might log into Facebook or turn on the television.
It's also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist.
And I was five years old in Lynchburg, Virginia, a skinny black kid in a kind of somewhat racist town. And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life.
And I'm thinking, "OK, bread truck, me delivering bread while my dad's driving the truck." I'm like, "OK, I'm going to be a bread guy now." But he says, "This is our camper." I'm like, "Dude, come one, I can read: 'Merita Bread and Rolls' on the side of this truck.
It showed me what it meant to be an explorer, at a very early age.
And I suppressed all that negativity, all that trauma, because I was learning to be an explorer.
And so I knew I could be a chemist. So as I went on this journey through a high school, and I went to college, and I got a football scholarship to play football in college.
And I knew that I could be a chemist, because I'd already blown stuff up.
And this friend of mine said, "Leland, you'd be great astronaut." I just laughed at him, I was like, "Yeah, me, an astronaut?" You know that Neil and Buzz thing from back in '69?
However, standing before you today as a slightly inflated, time-battered version of myself five years later, I'm very confident.
And she knows that when she slips up, he’ll tap a touch screen, and she’ll be watching again, feeling like a kid in the corner with a dunce cap.
That’s the kind of future I dreamed of as a kid.
You know, I'm a proponent of studying guaranteed income, as one example, conversations about how health care gets provided and other benefits.
I was very excited, so I just dug right into this data.
Well, not to get too technical, but that sucked. (Laughter) I was really unhappy about this.
