I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them, when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured.
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition, expecting to find a revision worth noting.
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me.
And I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why. Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity" is the idea that success, or happiness, is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience, as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics, or what other people perceive as my disability.
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins." And I turn around, and it's this older man.
This man was Dr. Kean, a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day, because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them, not in spite of the experiences I've had with them. And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
This is what I call the "I'm Not Good At Life" face. This is actually me making it. Can you see? Yes. Good. This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." And he's an economist, so he's rational. And he says — (Laughter) Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
When I look forward to the next decade, I know two things for sure: that we can make any future we can imagine, and we can play any games we want, so I say: Let the world-changing games begin.
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that's it.
I was betting that I'd be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.
As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies, animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate — or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate — for people who are patients of doctors.
Understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.
It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the Fathers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
For years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex-difference research.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
As an artist, connection is very important to me.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. (Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store; at least at that time it was truly upscale.
I used to love going to this store, but on one occasion I asked myself, well how come you never buy anything?
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
I was terrified by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me, without tweeting it to my friends.
And actually I become a character in the book.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of, there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
And I realized, at the same time, that it is OK to be an outsider, a recent arrival, new on the scene — and not just OK, but something to be thankful for, perhaps a gift from the boat.
I made the decision to move to the US after only one trip. My hunches again. Three months later, I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The next morning FI woke up and I realized that what I was really angry about wasn't about what other people weren't doing, it was that I had heard this message years ago, and I hadn't moved on it.
So I'm all excited, I start driving to work, and the more I drive, the scareder I get.
Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it. "But it wouldn't let me go, because God loves to show up as us, and because I look broken and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness, there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud.
As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment that we can put over the side of the research vessel, and it measures oxygen and many more things.
I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that.
But I truly believe that, as a scientist, using mostly federal funds to do the research, I owe it to the public, to agency heads and congressional people to share my knowledge with them so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions about our environmental policy.
Back at work, I handed over the urgent things that needed to be done while I was having more tests to see if my cancer had spread.
That it would be my coworkers and my job that would make me feel valuable and human at times when I would have otherwise felt like a statistic.
Admittedly, a lot of that was through Doctor Google, perhaps not my best move and I wouldn't recommend that. (Laughter) But while I was ready for all the physical side effects, what really scared me was this thing called chemo brain.
And yes, these things were true some of the time, if not a lot of the time, but I was also determined to push myself at work as much as I had always done.
And I was able to do that because my employer gave me the choice.
And I was able to do that because my employer gave me the choice.
The single biggest investment in my life, and I was amazed how little self-determination, choice and, ultimately, control I had.
I come from a very small village in Punjab, Pakistan, where women are not allowed to pursue their higher education.
But in the end, I knew it's either me or them, and I chose myself.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
And that was the time when I first asked myself, "Why?
From lobbying for free and safe internet to convincing young women that access to the safe internet is their fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark to address the questions that have bothered me all these years.
If slavery didn't happen, who would I even be? "
I was born in Kigali, Rwanda.
I felt loved by my entire family and my neighbors.
When we would stop to rest for a little bit or search for food, I would close my eyes, hoping when I opened them, I would be awake.
I was drawn to oceanography by just this kind of challenge.
So I'm a scientist who studies life in the ocean.
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues who share this passion.
I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students.
But it was not the first time I've been humbled by a student's question.
This kind of honest, brave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now.
So later, I was left pondering this fury, and looking for an explanation as to why, even in her telling of it, I felt fury, too, and why this was a word and a feeling that I was hearing a lot about lately.
It was the first time we flew it, and the star of the show, of course, brother and sister side boosters landing. I was excited.
GS: I don't think I was nerdy, but I was definitely doing the things that the girls weren't doing.
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event, and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.
I don't think I'm dumb enough to do something for 16 years that I don't like doing.
But then once I realized that that's his job, and my job is to get the company close to comfortable so he can push again and put us back on that slope, then I started liking my job a lot more, instead of always being frustrated.
So as a victims' rights attorney fighting to increase the prospect of justice for survivors across the country and as a survivor myself, I'm not here to say, "Time's Up." I'm here to say, "It's time." It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence.
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s when I first heard those shocking facts and the scientist in me wanted to know why and how.
So I did what anyone appalled by politics would do: I ran for office, and I won.
After all, I was a scientist, I came from the world under attack, and I had personally felt the outrage.
And he asked if I would serve as his Minister of Science.
Excited, I bounced to my feet and flipped three more cartwheels before landing by her side.
In our last conversation before her death, she encouraged me to go anywhere in the world that would make me happy.
I'm a Harvard Business School professor, but I was super attracted to going to an organization that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire.
I went to Uber with the hopes that a turnaround there could give license to the rest of us who might have narrower versions of their challenges.
But when I got to Uber, I made a really big mistake.
I publicly committed to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day until every other employee was wearing an Uber T-shirt.
Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps,
I have been tempted at every step of my career, tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world.
When I got there, Uber was wobbling all over the place.
And I felt devastated.
So when IDA asked for help, I decided to launch CanDo seven months early, with very little money, and many people, including myself, thought I had finally gone mad.
My specialty, as a sex educator, is I bring the science.
Helen Walters: Emily, come up here. Thank you so much. I know that you do this all the time, and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you for having the courage to come and talk about that on this stage.
Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.
I was born in Korea — the land of kimchi; raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now; and I was educated in the US, where I became addicted to peanut butter.
She scanned all of my classmates, and she said, "You — you have to get a tutor, otherwise, you won't pass this class." But by then I was fluent in Spanish already, so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian, but not both.
So with this realization in mind, I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself — even allow myself to reinvent myself at times.
When I was nearly done with my PhD, I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug.
Now, today my identity quest is no longer to find my tribe. It's more about allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating diversity within me and not just around me. My boys now are three years and five months old today, and they were already born with three nationalities and four languages.
So I managed to get my hands on what we call a big rig in flow cytometry, a large, powerful laser with a money-back guarantee from the company that if it didn't work on a ship, they would take it back.
And it was about that time that I became so smitten by these little cells that I redirected my entire lab to study them and nothing else, and my loyalty to them has really paid off.
And it was about that time that I became so smitten by these little cells that I redirected my entire lab to study them and nothing else, and my loyalty to them has really paid off.
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist, and I study these types of cases.
As a researcher, a professor and a new parent, my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults.
People were very angry about how Brendan was questioned, and many assumed that his interrogation had to have been illegal. It wasn't illegal. As someone who's a researcher in this area and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals, I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.
As a parent and as a researcher, I think we can do better.
And I find myself amazed by the lifesaving work that he and his colleagues do each and every day.
When I was a kid, I was, like many of you in this room, very much fascinated by Star Wars, and what fascinated me the most is this notion of the Force, this energy that connects all people and all objects and allows you to feel people that you can't even see.
And I remember many nights, I would be sitting at home, just, like, concentrating and focusing, trying to feel the Force, and I didn't feel anything, don't worry.
And later in life, I became a scientist.
But then, again, this Force thing kept nagging me, and at some point, I was just like, "Wait a minute, these wireless signals — they are like the Force."
I'm sure many of you have seen this picture.
So when I started, I told you that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars and the Force in Star Wars, and indeed, I'm still very much fascinated, even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars, waiting for the next movie.
But I'm very fascinated now and excited about this new Force of wireless signals, and the potential of changing health care with this new force.
She has heart failure, and I'm sure many of you guys in the audience have parents, grandparents, loved ones who have chronic diseases.
So glad you're breathing.
I was born and brought up in Mumbai.
on the grounds — Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate. I was terrified. I was crying. And by coming back home, I was continuously crying.
When I was pregnant with my first child, I was always hungry.
I went to Sunita's house to celebrate — to congratulate her.
When I entered the village, I saw a big cutout of Sunita.
I was really surprised to see an untouchable, coming from the village, having a big cutout at the entrance of the village.
When I went to her house, I was even more amazed because upper caste leaders — men — were sitting in the house, in her house, and having chai and water, which is very rare in India.
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women.
They are sharing their stories with me, they are sharing their wisdom with me, and I'm just lucky to be with them.
20 years before — and I'm so proud — we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank.
I grew up a feral, adopted child on the northern shore of Lake Ontario, following my bricklayer / fisherman father around.
I was always fascinated by things that moved, catching small animals, holding them in my hands, feeling the magic of their movement; playing with fire, thrilled and terrified at its unrelenting force, accidentally burning my father's barn down — just once. (Laughter) That was my first brush with real danger, the fire and my father.
I was seized with a compulsion, a primordial urge to learn how to fly, like a human.
I got my degree in modern dance.
I dove horizontally through glass; on the way, I punched a hole in it.
When I was 27 years old, I found myself in a rat-infested New York City loft, getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.
I climbed higher, higher, higher, and I jumped. Wham-o! I landed. That hurt. (Laughter) And it occurred to me that people didn't really enjoy getting hurt, and that maybe the reason that we weren't flying yet is that we were still attached to that false idea that we would fly the way birds do, or butterflies.
So I made my body into a perfect line and tilted back. Whaft! It was a totally different sound than "wham-o." And I rushed out onto the streets of New York City and went up to complete strangers, and I said — well, I thought — "I did a backfall today. Did you?"
I came across this quote by Wilbur: "If you are looking for perfect safety, you will do well to sit on a fence and watch the birds; but if you really wish to learn, you must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks by actual trial."
Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the positive response that I received, not only from academia, but also patients, and people around the world affected by this terrible disease.
It blows my mind to think that all this, the incredible work that I'm pursuing — and the fact that I'm standing here, talking to you today — all came from this tiny idea that I had when I was sitting at the back of a seminar when I was just 20 years old.
As a teacher, I've stood in front of 120 students, so this stage does not intimidate me.
I only stayed in the camp for three years, though.
Education shall be your first husband. "And with these words came in his first big investment. I felt lucky!
My mother had been left behind in the camp, and I had not seen her since I left it.
I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death.
I've never felt so stuck.
But then, in 2012, life took away the only thing that I was clinging on. My father died. My grades in school started to collapse, and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015, I was devastated to receive a C grade.
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And I'm so proud of that.
I began by saying that I am a teacher.
But once again, I have become a student.
In March, I moved to Rwanda on a scholarship program called "Bridge2Rwanda." It prepares scholars for universities.
And I totally get it, my friends, I have also been there.
When I was a Child Protective Services worker, I saw things like this all the time.
And in 2016, I went into that community with my team and led a research study, discovering the use of blind removal meetings.
I'm that friend.
And the thing that I'm single-minded about is racism.
And the reason I'm single-minded about racism is because I know single-mindedness can destroy it.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern.
So I set out to learn more about the psychology of motherhood.
I've been building on the anthropology literature and have been talking about matrescence with my patients using a concept called the "push and pull."
I've worked all my life in the field of security and defense, and I am convinced that now, more than ever, we need to radically reframe the way we think and act about security, and especially about international security.
My broken pelvis and I were now facing six weeks on the couch, and I would have gone absolutely insane if it hadn't been for my friends.
That was 21 years ago, and for 19 of those years, I have been married to that marvelous introvert who never in a million years would have approached me under other circumstances.
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.
I saw as they approached the gate one night, and felt an immediate connection to them.
I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy.
Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought.
But I know it's not the same photograph that I would have seen, because I wouldn't take my oath to be a police officer until 1989.
And I'm going to be really upset.
Which meant a greater likelihood to get funded. I was sold. The idea, though, of doing it together still seemed a little crazy.
So one day, I walked into one of the biggest libraries in Italy in search of an Arabic book.
But you know, in my situation, and because I was raised to criticize by creating, it's Michelangelos.
I told you today that someone said to me words that marked me, because I explained the same thing to my employees in Senegal.
If you were only charging me 5 percent to get my stuff in the country, my raw material, instead of the 45 percent, do you really think that I would have to go a pay a bribe?
So I did the natural thing. I quit, and I went back to grad school to study the effects of this.
Does people's performance really suffer? "I was curious about that, too.
After all, I was the so-called expert there, the former 20-year television news anchor and life and business coach.
Eventually, I stumbled upon a private company to issue a DMCA notice to shut the website down.
And to get started, I asked myself this one simple question: Who do I need to become now?
I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents and we moved to Denmark when I was a young child.
I was elected, but I soon found out that not everyone was happy about it as I had to quickly get used to finding hate messages in my inbox.
Several weeks later I was at a friend's house, and I was very upset and angry about all the hate and racism I had met.
When I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me, I was sure that the driver was a racist.
When I got home, I was very ambivalent about my experience.
Gradually, and painfully, I came to realize that I had been just as judgmental of those who had sent me hate mails as they had been of me.
I grew up in a working-class family, and on my journey I have met many people who have insisted on speaking to me.
Maybe at this point, do you think I am an idealist?
I'm a social scientist. I study the psychology of good people, and research in my field says many of us care deeply about feeling like a good person and being seen as a good person.
But like all of our friends at the library, I am busy, I lose track of things, my house is sometimes messy, and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa.
And I have been fortunate enough to be able to pay that 500 dollars over the last several years.
As Michael might have mentioned, I've been a librarian for 15 years and my mom hasn't been in a library in decades, because when she was young, she lost a book.
Now, you might think I've forgotten a money piece, where we need to finance libraries, right?
They had big muscles, supermodel good looks, and phenomenal cosmic powers. And me? I kind of looked like this, except shorter and with frizzier hair, and I never felt powerful.
And I'd sit there at my grandmother's dining room table and I'd listen to the women in my family tell these wild, rambunctious tales about navigating their lives in the Bronx.
I mean, her and Storm even hug. I know. And that's because my mentors loved me enough to encourage me to investigate myself and my ancestors, and when you're 19, how do you even know what that means?
I have been propelled by possibility for most of my life.
In 2006, 12 years ago, I laid across a mattress on my floor in my one-bedroom apartment, frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community.
I'm exhausted, and I'm numb.
When I was in high school at the age of 17 — I graduated from high school in Decatur, Georgia, as valedictorian of my high school — I was very proud of myself.
I was from a low-income community, I had grown up in Mississippi, we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia so my parents could pursue their degrees as United Methodist ministers.
I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community.
And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are: One, am I honest about the scope of my ambition?
Now, you may have heard, I'm in a little bit of debt.
What's your secret? "And to be honest, for many years, my answer would be," I don't know.
I focused on a critical yet largely untapped resource for election modernization: local election officials.
For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia.
And 10 years ago, I decided to increase my medical knowledge and I received a nursing degree.
I am trained to put out many different types of fires.
I am trained to save a life in the moment.
But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction between first responders, the health care community, social services and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.
So a couple of months ago, I walked out on the apparatus floor, where I had some firefighters.
So a couple of weeks ago, I had a neighbor overdose. Twenty-two years old. So of course, I hurried down to help my firefighters and my neighbor.
Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse.
As a museum curator I understand why these stories are so seductive. Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational. But those stories are limiting. By definition, being extraordinary is nonrepresentative. It's atypical. Those stories do not create a broad base for incorporating women's history, and they don't reflect our daily realities. If we can collectively apply that radical notion that women are people, it becomes easier to show women as people are: familiar, diverse, present.
As an Afro-Latina I'm one of millions. As an Afro-Latina curator I'm one of very few. And bringing my whole self into the professional realm can feel like an act of bravery, and I'll admit to you that I was not always up for that challenge, whether from fear of rejection or self-preservation. In meetings, I would only speak up when I had a fully developed comment to share. No audible brainstorming or riffing off of colleagues. For a long time, I denied myself the joy of wearing my beloved hoop earrings or nameplate necklace to work, thinking that they were too loud or unscholarly or unprofessional.
Just last month, I was invited to keynote a Latino Heritage Month event. The week of the presentation, the organization expressed concerns. They called my slides "activist," and they meant that negatively.
Respectability politics and idealized femininity influence how we display women and which women we choose to display. And that display has skewed toward successful and extraordinary and reputable and desirable, which maintains the systemic exclusion and marginalization of the everyday, the regular, the underrepresented and usually, the nonwhite. As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative.
But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club I walked in and I had this giant banner that had a Four-Way-Test on it. Is it the truth? Absolutely. Is it fair? Heck, no, that's why I care most about climate change, because it is absolutely unfair.
I'm a scientist, I know.
I'm a climate scientist, so the irony of traveling around to talk to people about a changing climate is not lost on me.
I was surrounded by a sea of 20-something professionals glued to their phones.
The first man I fell in love with was Mr. Darcy.
But I was also like all those people I saw around me: I, too, lived on my phone.
And when I did the long commute back home like most urban Indians, and was stuck in traffic, I passed the time on WhatsApp, video-chatting my twin.
And as for me, I've discovered that as I entered the six-inch world of the smartphone, my own world just got very, very big.
In my work as a researcher and educator, I've had an opportunity to work with girls like Stacy, a girl who I profile in my book "Pushout," who struggles with her participation in violence.
I remind myself that the heart can simply break, or it can break open.
There is no coincidence that I am here as a landscape architect.
As a child, I grew up in a row house next to the busy road always filled with traffic.
I want to take you all on a journey to the place I was raised, northwest Pakistan, called Dir.
Growing up, I was very close to my father.
And I felt so helpless at that time.
So I ran for a public office as an independent candidate in Lower Dir in the local elections in 2001.
Even I had to leave, leaving my children behind with my in-laws.
So when the jury selection process took place, they asked me, "Could you, if the evidence presented justified the death penalty, could you deliver, rationally and without reservations, a penalty of death?" My answer was an astounding "yes," and I was selected as Juror Number 2.
However, if I talked or tried to talk about the trauma outside her office, I was shut down.
He was just a murderer. Get over it. It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor.
On my way home, I stopped by a restaurant and bought a margarita.
I'm here to tell you my story, because it was precisely 22 years later that I even wanted to open up enough to talk about it, when a friend encouraged me. "Hey, perhaps you need to talk to the other jurors.
Uncertain of what I was after, I did need to talk to them.
So I set out on my quest, and I actually found most of them.
Well, it dawned on me that this child was being raised in the same eye-for-an-eye culture as I was, or had been.
And I asked her, "Did that make me a murderer?" She couldn't answer.
I got invited to speak, just recently, in an abolitionist community.
Well, when I get home, my 16-year-old granddaughter was there, Anna, and she says, "Can I have that shirt?" Well, I looked at her dad — her dad is my son — and I knew that he is still dealing with this death penalty issue.
So I turned around and I looked at her, and I said, "Are you gonna wear this?" So she turned and she looked at her dad, and she said, "Dad, I know how you feel, but I don't believe in the death penalty." My son looked at me, shook his head, and said, "Thanks, Mom." And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."

Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can "solve the climate crisis." But the climate crisis has already been solved.
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.
These three identities forced me to think that I should never have been born.
Yet, I was. All throughout my childhood, as I rolled bidis alongside my mother, I would wonder: What did my future hold?
I often asked my mother, with a lot of anxiety, "Amma, will my life be different from yours?
Will I go to college? "And she would reply back," Try to finish high school first. "I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.
I wanted to have a college degree like her, so I fought with my father and my relatives to be sent to college, and it worked.
After many rounds of interviews, I got into the fellowship program with a full scholarship.
My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
Of the 97 fellows selected that year, I was the only rural college graduate.
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.
Another asked me where I had learned to speak English, and some of my peers did not prefer to have me on their assignment teams because they thought I would not be able to contribute to their discussion.
That meant I was going to be on television.
As an undergraduate student, I fell in love with one of them... Mrs. Ples.
But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
The research team that I was invited to join was tasked with describing, comparing and analyzing the fossils, with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged.
And I've found, when I log on as myself, with my own photo, my own name, I tend to get questions or comments like this: "What makes you think you're qualified to talk about AI?" "What makes you think you know about machine learning?" So, as you do, I made a new profile, and this time, instead of my own picture, I chose a cat with a jet pack on it.
So, this time, I didn't get any of those patronizing comments about my ability and I was able to actually get some work done.
So, I'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story about the existential risk, robots taking over and coming for your jobs.
But I feel incredibly positive about this technology.
