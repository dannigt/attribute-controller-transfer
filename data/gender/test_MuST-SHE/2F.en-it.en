And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
If you're queasy — (Laughs) if you faint easily — I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know, and one woman almost passed out.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio, no way. Fine. Why? Because we don't have polio.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
And since you don't know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear — (Laughter) that means I found a few things.
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
Most females like me — I believe myself to be a typical female — I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical — most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does — the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average — not everyone, but on average — are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.
We found her one, we got her there, and we took care of her and watched over her family, because it was necessary. It's something we knew how to do.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
But I actually think that "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" is probably the most important video game ever made, principally because it was the first and the last time that parents, teachers and kids all agreed that a video game was awesome.
And it may surprise you to know that "Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?" continues to be the last substantial giant hit in the entertainment business, despite the fact that it was 1987, which is such an incredibly long time ago, and I'm only 36, so you can do the math.
You not only get to cover science, but you get to meet interesting scientists, like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling, she, of the magic research high tops there.
In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.
Germaine Greer has wondered about the same things and she says, "At breakfast and at dinner, we can sharpen our own appetites with a plentiful dose of the pornography of war, genocide, destitution and disease." She's right.
And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
I sent her home without speaking to my attending.
The three words are: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. "Well she's back," in just that tone of voice.
Well she was back all right.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And over the next two or three days, it was clear that she was never going to wake up.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go — Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
Why did I send her home?
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago. Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go — that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today.

My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined. I didn't know the protocols.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb — a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat. "No" had never been an option. "Just do it," she said, "and don't be what you're not."
Her mother raised her alone.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
She was born in the 1880's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious.
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott — amazing African-American woman — and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
She wakes up every morning, tired from the night before, baby attached to her breast, dropping this kid off at school, and taking this one to the park.
And she... There was no thinking she wasn't serious when she peered at the audience, and I thought, "Surely she's looking at me." "You know, I'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey.
Pick another state, any state, I just don't want to hear it anymore. "But she was able to move the action plan across President George H.W. Bush's desk so that we had environmental goals and that we were working to solve them.
Another student gave us feedback that she had learned to design with empathy, as opposed to designing for functionality, which is what her engineering education had taught her.
So I'm very embarrassed to tell you all that I stood up and I walked around to where she was sitting so that I could look over her shoulder and verify what was written on the page in front of her. (Laughter)
And I was figuring out how I was going to tell my mother, who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me.
And I thought about what could be done to guide these conversations, and then an amazing colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn, developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit. The toolkit provides a framework for those diagnosed, their managers, their carers and their coworkers to have conversations about cancer and the work support available.
If I hate my body, in particular, the parts society deems feminine or female, I potentially damage how my kid can see the possibilities of her body and her feminine and female parts.
Now it would be easier for me to choose option one: to ignore my kid when she asks me about my body or to hide it from her.
And when she's developmentally able to, I want to talk to her about my journey with my body.
And when Elliot was first born, we took her to the pediatrician and we met our first nurse — we'll call her Sarah.
And when Elliot was first born, we took her to the pediatrician and we met our first nurse — we'll call her Sarah.
Very early in in our time with Sarah, we told her how I was going to be called "dad" and my partner is "mama." Sarah was one of those folks that took it in stride, and our subsequent visits went pretty smoothly.
And about a year later, Sarah switched shifts and we started working with a new nurse — we'll call her Becky.
We didn't get in front of the dad conversations and it didn't actually come up until Sarah, our original nurse, walked in to say hi.
Sarah's warm and bubbly and said hi to Elliot and me and my wife and when talking to Elliot said something like, "Is your daddy holding your toy?" Now out of the corner of my eye, I could see Becky swing around in her chair and make daggers at Sarah.
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes in the name of so-called "family honor"; where women are left to die right outside their houses for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor." Let me say this very clearly: it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder.
From lobbying for free and safe internet to convincing young women that access to the safe internet is their fundamental, basic, human right, I'm trying to play my part in igniting the spark to address the questions that have bothered me all these years.
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box.
That she can't forget how, growing up, she was called a dirty Jew with horns and tails.
But Lisa knows she can pass as white so she benefits from huge systemic and interpersonal privileges, and so she spends every day grappling with ways that she can leverage that white privilege for social justice.
Her grandmother told her firmly a saying in Cherokee, "I don't tell me who you are, you tell me who you are.
My older sister Claire, she became a young mother... and a master at getting things done.
And a couple of months before I met her, she'd had the operation.
We'd saved the sight that she had left, and she was free of pain. She could sleep. She could work, she could socialize.
On average, it's estimated that 50 women were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes.
She was the first person who spoke to me about learning from the other side.
So, I have a friend. She's an actress, she's in her 60s.
It was really crowded, as it is around the holidays, and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused.
He apparently needed something that she was blocking, so he moved her.
Maybe he had said something to her, maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it... Either way, she was focused, she was filling out the form.
And the next thing you know, there were hands on her, and she was being moved out of the way.
She said that she was shocked at first — yeah.
And she went on to say, "I mean, I wanted to get physical. I don't know — I was furious.
When women get manhandled, we start to rationalize, try to figure out the ways that it was — "It was probably our fault.
Women have been trained to think that we are overreacting or that we're being too sensitive or unreasonable.
I asked my mom, who was an artist, when I was in third grade, how a car worked, so she had no idea so she gave me a book, and I read it, and sure enough, my first job out of my mechanical engineering degree was with Chrysler Motors in the automotive industry.
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think.
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male." But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
She pulls back the covers and makes the gruesome discovery. Vera was dead. When it comes to Spanish flu, those stories are common, of lightning speed deaths.
She had a love of fashion and worked in a sewing factory in lower Manhattan, until she saved up enough to open her own women's clothing store.
It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.
The one in the back puts her arms around her and consoles her.
As soon as I hung up, she comes to me and says, "I didn't know you could do that.
I'm a woman of super strong opinions, with really deep convictions, direct speech.
People survive because of people like Malak, who, despite sustaining a severe burns injury in the line of duty, the first thing she did when discharged from hospital was to go back caring for small children.
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman, she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things and I was like, 'I want you right now.' And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.'
Another friend, back in college, told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship. She told me that her partner tied her up with her arms over her head like this, she's standing up and he positions her so she's straddling a bar, presses up against her clitoris, like this.
Another friend, back in college, told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship. She told me that her partner tied her up with her arms over her head like this, she's standing up and he positions her so she's straddling a bar, presses up against her clitoris, like this.
It's a power play. Leaves her alone. So there's my friend, and she goes, "I'm bored."
And the guy comes back and she says, "I am bored." And he looks at her and he looks at the bar and he says, "Then why are you wet?" Why was she wet?
She was with a partner, a new partner, glad to be doing things, and they reached a point where that was as far as she was interested in going and so she said no.
Did he listen to her words?
But even though I know it's difficult to sit with those feelings in a room full of strangers, if we can find our way through all of the messy feelings, I believe we will find our way to the light of compassion for that child, whose relationship with her body was damaged by an adult whose job it was to protect it.
A little easier for your friend on the phone, worried that she's broken.
Finally, the doors opened, and she said, "She's gone.
She's gone. "She started sobbing and immediately said," We must make arrangements.
Then I became an investor, a woman in tech, a teacher.
Now, as for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me. It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there.
She jumped at the opportunity.
She did not flinch. Why? Well, it's a personal why.
While working on this in our office, we've realized that we're building upon the work of our colleagues, including architect Tatiana Bilbao, working in Mexico City; Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena, working in Chile; and recent Pritzker winner Balkrishna Doshi, working in India.
When my desperation was clearly coming through my voice, much as it is now, the receptionist took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps what you need is a rehab facility or a methadone clinic." I didn't know any better at the time, so I took her advice.
They wanted her piecemealed, papier-mâchéd, practically broken, limp-like and loveless, a litany of exaggeration. They wanted her low. And high. Flat and wide. Filled with all of their empty.
That she was birthed in sandalwood-scented river water, sweet sapphire honey-touched tongue, she was too much of a mouthful for the greedy.
Oh, they wanted her bland. And barren. Unspirited, un-African, uncultured, under siege in the streets.
They wanted her face down, ass up, hands cuffed and ankles strapped.
Oh, they wanted her holy, baptized in her divine, they wanted her secrets, pearls to swine.
Fascinated by glory, hypnotized by her kind.
Oh, they wanted her complete.
They wanted her whole, though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul, with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.
Wild women have hurricanes in their bellies, releasing a flood of a lesson.
For wild women are not to be tamed. Only admired. Just let her in and witness her set your days ablaze.
I knew that if in one hour, our child didn't come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple's CEO.
And today, Kerabai is doing a regular radio program, and not only that, she's become a famous radio jockey and she has been invited by all of the radios, even from Mumbai.
She gets the invitation and she does the show.
She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor.
It is a very male-dominated profession and it is all the more difficult for Sunita because Sunita comes from an untouchable caste. But she worked very hard. She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor.
Today they are pushing me to go to National Stock Exchange to set up the first fund dedicated to micro rural women entrepreneurs.
Nine years ago, my sister discovered lumps in her neck and arm and was diagnosed with cancer.
My mother was his second wife, married to him at the age of 16.
I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister.
My mother had been left behind in the camp, and I had not seen her since I left it.
They said her family did not find it fit for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial, simply because we were girls.
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.
Sometimes they will jokingly say, "You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become." But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern.
It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
She says, "I'm not good at this. I'm not enjoying this. Do I have postpartum depression?"
So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis, and it's clear to me that she's not clinically depressed, and I tell her that.
But she isn't reassured. "It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.
What did you expect it to feel like? "She says," I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
I was getting calls with questions like this from hundreds of women, all concerned that something was wrong, because they couldn't measure up.
But at the same time, her mind is pushing away, because she remembers there are all these other parts to her identity — other relationships, her work, hobbies, a spiritual and intellectual life, not to mention physical needs: to sleep, to eat, to exercise, to have sex, to go to the bathroom, alone —
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence, if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull, if they knew that under these circumstances, ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of, they would feel less alone, they would feel less stigmatized, and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter, who did all my illustrations.
Her daughter's been taken hostage by an android, and of course, she's in a state of shock.
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the threesome."
They present impossible and perilous choices: Do you take your child to get her flu medicine, or do you feed her?
And I often wondered if, you know, how did they perceive me, this woman in uniform?
Onion looks gorgeous in her bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific.
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group.
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly.
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for an even number of black hats since one was behind her.
She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, "Niels, it's hard.
And one of them started crying — her name is Yahara. She started crying. I said, "Why are you crying?" She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe — always seeing us represented as poor people — I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10. And that leaves a few of you in this audience as potential victims.
The day I ended my silence, I freed myself from shame. And I freed myself from the fear of judgment from the one person who I thought would judge me the most — my son, who actually told me, "Mom, you are the strongest person that I know. You can get through this. And besides, mom — he chose the wrong woman to mess with."
The day I ended my silence, I freed myself from shame. And I freed myself from the fear of judgment from the one person who I thought would judge me the most — my son, who actually told me, "Mom, you are the strongest person that I know. You can get through this. And besides, mom — he chose the wrong woman to mess with."
Although since then I've become a mother, nine months ago, and I've learned that babies also squirm when you hold them upside down.
Belle Gibson was a happy young Australian.
But in 2009, Belle learned that she had brain cancer and four months to live.
But Belle was determined.
She'd been a fighter her whole life.
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament as one of the first women with a minority background.
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament as one of the first women with a minority background.
Now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger, but she's not alone.
Like, for example, when I got an email from a female student in my class saying that a reading I had assigned, a reading I had been assigning for years, was sexist.
And she told him she grew up visiting her local library, she loved it.
My tías were cops and paramedics, my abuelas were seamstresses and sold jewelry up the street, and my mom got her master's degree in education and taught kindergarten in New York City public schools for over 30 years.
And I don't know how much time you've spent with Puerto Rican women from the Bronx, but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers.
The funny, the goofy, the gentle — those were my in to storytelling, so much so that I wrote a young-adult novel called "Juliet Takes a Breath," about a chubby, queer Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx navigating sexuality, family and identity.
She's tough, Latina, and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.
And also, when I looked at America, I saw a young Latina in survival mode.
See, because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe when she was a kid, and she'd been on her own ever since.
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft on her own.
and the first thing I did was enroll her in Justice Sonia Sotomayor University.
Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated but a university dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States?
And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You," and America is so excited, she's ready to show off her strength, she's ready to show off her portal-punching skills,
But I didn't want America to be alone for long, and so in a homework assignment gone totally wrong, she lands on a battlefield with the X-Men.
And no one has ever offered her silence and deep reflection as a way to be powerful.
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong, luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above.
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong, luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above.
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
It's about the 84 percent of trans women who will be sexually assaulted this year and the indigenous women who are three-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually assaulted than any other group.
It's about the 60 percent of black girls like me who will be experiencing sexual violence before they turn 18, and the thousands and thousands of low-wage workers who are being sexually harassed right now on jobs that they can't afford to quit.
Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated and told they don't belong.
Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party.
I think that too often, our public representations of women are enveloped in the language of the extraordinary. The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire: Madam C. J. Walker... The dresses of the first ladies of the United States... Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek the US Democratic party's presidential nomination —
That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated. I canceled the talk, explaining to them that their censorship of me and my work made me uncomfortable.
And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer Mahasweta Devi died, our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit.
And one day, you get an in-app notification and it says that your favorite actress has written a sexy short story and it's waiting for you.
You see, Mom was having issues with memory loss and accepting her age. She looked defeated. I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, but when I was at my easel, painting, I would peek over and see her just... there.
At a young age, her father died of pneumonia, leaving his wife and two daughters alone with all the heavy chores.
Mom, the oldest, at 13, was married off to a complete stranger twice her age.
She went from being just a kid and was pushed into adulthood.
Years later, and now living in Toronto, Mom got work in a clothing factory and soon became manager of a very large sewing department.
After that bathroom "aha!" moment, I practiced my newfound camera skills with Mom as portrait model.
She felt worthy again, she felt wanted and needed.
She would say, "How did I get so old, so fast?"
I also gave Mom a project to do, to keep her busy and thinking.
Our fight lasted less than two minutes, but it was a perfect reflection of the hurricane that was building inside of me as a young survivor of sexual assault and as a girl who was grappling with abandonment and exposure to violence in other spaces in my life.
A teacher broke up the fight and my principal called me in her office.
Believing that a girl is older than she is can lead to harsher treatment, immediate censure when she makes a mistake and victim blaming when she's harmed.
Qualities that are often measured in relation to nonblack girls and which don't take into consideration what's going on in this girl's life or her cultural norms.
Middle school girls are being turned away from school because of the way they wear their hair naturally or because of the way the clothes fit their bodies.
She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses that science has to offer about how her adverse childhood experiences inform why she's participating in violence and goes straight to describing herself as a "problem child," largely because that's the language that educators were using as they routinely suspended her.
And as a result, their truancy and suspension rates have improved, and girls are arriving at school increasingly ready to learn because they know the teachers there care about them. That matters.
Our ability to see her promise should be at its sharpest when she's in the throws of poverty and addiction; when she's reeling from having been sex-trafficked or survived other forms of violence; when she's at her loudest, or her quietest.
Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower-income countries say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant but aren't using contraception.
Now, I was a young woman, and my place was in the home. I was very upset. But most of my family members, they were happy with this decision.
I engaged many women and girls to work with me. It was hard. Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married, because their husbands wouldn't let them work.
One colleague of mine was given away by her family to make amends for a crime her brother had committed.
All these elected women now share, discuss and resolve their problems together.
You can see, this young lady, age 26, she ran for a public office in 2015 in Lower Dir, and she won.
And another young woman is Asma Gul.
She was unable to run for the public office, so she has become the first female journalist of our region.
So I turned around and I looked at her, and I said, "Are you gonna wear this?" So she turned and she looked at her dad, and she said, "Dad, I know how you feel, but I don't believe in the death penalty." My son looked at me, shook his head, and said, "Thanks, Mom." And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."
As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family, I was fairly clear from a very early age that no one expected anything from me.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
As a woman, I could not be seen with a cell phone, so I used to huddle his phone under my shawl and type as slowly as possible to ensure that I would not be heard.
My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
When I saw my mother's first signature on her bidi-rolling wage book, when I felt the hot Delhi air against my face after a 50-hour train journey, when I finally felt free and let myself be, I saw a glimpse of that new world I longed for, a world where a girl like me is no longer a liability or a burden but a person of use, a person of value and a person of worthiness.
Well, six months ago, we had a new joinee. Her name is Kaviarasi. I first spotted her in a local college in Tirunelveli during one of my training sessions.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.
She told me that she wanted to make sure that she would never be a liability or a burden to anyone at any point in her life.
I first traveled there in 2003, and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.
And then they want to put on some music, and maybe order some food, and now, they are barking orders at an obedient female voice assistant.
Another study found that when women coders on one platform hid their gender, like myself, their code was accepted four percent more than men.
We need women to be the makers and not just the machines who do the makers' bidding.
