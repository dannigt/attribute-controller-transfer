Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?
Now, that is three weeks, and that is at most an hour and a half. There seems to be a discrepancy. Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know, in how little appetite I have for consuming memories, but even if you do more of this, there is a genuine question: Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences?
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that, which reveals, for me, all the issues in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
And I was always absorbed in a book, science fiction book, which took my mind to other worlds, and satisfied, in a narrative form, this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
You know, I was a real science geek.
And I was an artist. I could draw. I could paint. And I found that because there weren't video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape, I had to create these images in my head.
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth.
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15.
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada, 600 miles from the nearest ocean. But I didn't let that daunt me.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
And so that got me very excited.
But, it struck me how much this dive, these deep dives, was like a space mission.
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.
So, I was completely smitten by this, and had to do more.
After the success of "Titanic," I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while." And so, we started planning these expeditions.
And we wound up going to the Bismark, and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck of Titanic, sitting in a submersible, and looking out at planks that look much like this, where I knew that the band had played.
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic.
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well — again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with the space community, really involved with NASA, sitting on the NASA advisory board, planning actual space missions, going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut biomedical protocols, and all these sorts of things, to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems.
I'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan, you know, as a kid, and doing this stuff for real.
People sort of think I went away between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails someplace, sitting at the beach.
So, when I came back to make my next movie, which was "Avatar," I tried to apply that same principle of leadership, which is that you respect your team, and you earn their respect in return.
I fell out of love with this fish. (Laughter) No, not because I'm some self-righteous, goody-two shoes foodie.
It's great, but I was in love.
For some time I have been interested in the placebo effect, which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in, unless you think of it in the terms that I do, which is, "Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real." In other words, sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies, the placebo effect, just because the person thinks that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a — for pain management, for example, if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me, was an astonishing thing.
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.
I'm sorry, man.
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around. I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away, don't look at the thing.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel, whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row, because he reminds me why I became a musician.
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker. A little story. And I was amazed to find opposition: opposition to what is, after all, the most effective public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do, so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
When I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company.
I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in.
Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature, just because he beat me by five seconds.
Well, I was next.
So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went — up the stairs, down the hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes.
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis.
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous.
In fact, most of my career, I've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging, that make them interesting, that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience.
I sent out some Facebook messages, some Twitter messages, and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk. (Laughter) That's right, some lucky individual, corporation, for-profit or non-profit, was going to get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity — because I'm sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again — (Laughter) to buy the naming rights to the talk you're watching right now, that at the time didn't have a title, didn't really have a lot of content and didn't really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be.
And as I said earlier, I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could ready me, for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys. (Laughter) You see, I had this idea for a movie.
None of them wanted anything to do with this movie. I was amazed. They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project.
And I was blown away, because I thought the whole concept, the idea of advertising, was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible, to get as many people to see it as possible.
But with only one company, one agency willing to help me — and that's only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years — I realized that I would have to go on my own, I'd have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team.
Lawyer: I'm a lawyer brand.
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check, and instead, I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there — I'm like, "All right, here's the deal: Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine, and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this, and we were like, "Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things, why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome."
I feel like I had been held underwater, and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe. "Isn't that awesome?
I'm not a programmer, never done anything with ocular recognition technology, but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I became enamored of the power of evolution, and I realized something very fundamental: in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms, each cell simply divides, and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells.
Now I have to confess, when I was a college undergraduate, I thought, okay, sex / death, sex / death, death for sex — it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with each passing year, I've come to have increasing doubts.
I came to realize, as a physician, that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution — not necessarily contradictory, just different.
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer, and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don't want to bother them, or, frankly, scare them.
You know, what I do is write for children, and I'm probably America's most widely read children's author, in fact.
And I always tell people that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers, and no one has ever chose farmer.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.
I was not a serious participant, but I was following along closely from the start, and it was just amazing.
And today, I'm very pleased to say, as a result, you can go online — anybody here — and download the human genome.
I was paying close attention earlier, and I now know I need to have 10 hours sleep at night, which is tricky, because last night the show ended about 12: 30, and so I was, I got — and that was in Santa Rosa, so I got home a little late.
And I believe, to a first order, it is over — not because index search is going away, but because, like word processing, it's gone from the most important application we all had, to just another thing we do.
No, I'm really serious about this.
Now, I know more about technology than most people, but that's just because I know more than most people who are 55.
But nonetheless, I managed to turn this love of video games into a job, first working on the Game Developers Conference, helping to start the first successful digital distribution company in games, called Trymedia, and then now, writing the Gamification blog. I'm author of two books on the subject of gamification, including the recent "Gamification by Design," published by O'Reilly.
So when I get invited to an event like this, I'm sure that all of you expect me to get up here and say, "Games are awesome for your children." Right?
Because I'm a games guy and this is how I make my living.
In the beginning of my time there in 2000, I was very interested in communities.
Now, this was sounding pretty good to me, and I was excited about the potential of using a liquid fluoride reactor to power a lunar community.
Now, when we think deeper about things like these, the obvious response from people should be, "OK, well, that sounds bad, but that doesn't really affect me, because I'm a legal citizen.
I was an obsessive compulsive student.
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything, or as much as possible, as close to everything as possible, that it would immunize me against making mistakes.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation.
And I felt really good.
Don't do this. "In fact, so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker," Do you think it's okay if she goes home? "And the nurse thought about it and said very matter-of-factly," Yeah, I think she'll do okay. "I can remember that like it was yesterday.
And I went back to my work on the wards.
And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don't usually do.
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.
And I was shocked and shaken to the core.
Over the next few weeks, I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine — where I felt alone, isolated, not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel, because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.
And I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again, please make the voices stop. And they did. And I went back to work.
Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto, and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.
It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
I am a redefined physician. I'm human. I make mistakes. I'm sorry about that, but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people.
So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card, I have plenty for everyone in the room, and, in fact, everyone in the world, and it's right here. (Laughter) If I had really been a egotist, I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.
I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically, and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it.
And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.
I'm the trends manager at YouTube, and I professionally watch YouTube videos. It's true. So we're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters.
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City, I admit I wasn't very interested.
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited.
And I remember, when I was about eight or nine years old, waking up one morning, going into the living room, and all of my cousins were running around.
Have some beer. "Then he looked at me real hard and he said," Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you. "(Laughter) I said," Well, what are you talking about? "He said," Oh, Mama tells all the grandkids that they're special. "(Laughter) I was devastated.
I had the great privilege, when I was a young lawyer, of meeting Rosa Parks.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
I've come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done.
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed — overwhelmed.
And I got in my car and I went to this courthouse.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me and he hugged me.
Well I went into the courtroom.
And as soon as I walked inside, the judge saw me coming in.
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing in this courtroom?" And this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said, "I came into this courtroom to tell this young man, keep your eyes on the prize, hold on."
I've come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
And more than anything, for those of you who share that, I've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.
I'm a physicist by training.
Has anyone here ever worked a job they hated? (Laughter) OK, good, because I'm not alone and I have something to confess; I don't want you guys to judge me.
See, I was an artist, so I'd write songs for other artists.
I have become an advocate for stay-at-home parents. Why? Because finally, I was standing in their shoes.
As a child growing up in Nigeria, books sparked my earliest imagination, but films, films transported me to magical places with flying cars, to infinite space with whole universes of worlds to discover.
The combination of words and pictures did something inside my head that had never been done before, and I immediately fell in love with the medium of comics.
I became a voracious comic book reader, but I never brought them to school.
My parents definitely were not fans, and I was certain that my teachers wouldn't be either.
Eventually I became a published cartoonist, writing and drawing comic books for a living.
I also became a high school teacher.
I remember telling my students on the first day of every class that I was also a cartoonist.
My students didn't think I was cool. They thought I was kind of a dork.
At the time, I was also the school's educational technologist, which meant every couple of weeks I had to miss one or two periods of this Algebra 2 class because I was in another classroom helping another teacher with a computer-related activity.
I thought it was pretty awesome.
This surprised me, because my students are part of a generation that was raised on screens, so I thought for sure they would like learning from a screen better than learning from a page.
And I was so intrigued by this experience that I had with these comics lectures that I decided to focus my final master's project on comics.
Every merchant, when you ask them, "How did you get started in global trade?" they say, "Well, when my master settled me." And when I finally got it into my head to ask, "What is this' settling? '" it turns out that when you've done your apprenticeship with someone you work for, they are required — required — to set you up in business.
That's locally generated venture capital. Right? And I can say with almost certainty that the Igbo apprenticeship system that governs Alaba International Market is the largest business incubator platform in the world.
And I'm sure we'd all be pretty sad to see that.
Growing up in Perth as an overly cerebral kid...
I met with many people in southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky to listen to those stories and hear their concerns.
I'd been attacked at public testimony at a Congressional hearing by a congressman with ties to the energy industry.
Making revelations of space is what I do; I'm a designer and creative director, and that's what I do for a living.
I bet you're wondering, "How expensive could the set possibly be to transform you if you sit for two hours and 20 minutes in inky-black darkness?" The answer is: cheap!
No — I'm going through it. "And I hit the puddle, and — ffftt! — all the water underneath my car, and instantly, I have an aha moment.
And I suppose I could mention from one of the very earliest computer scientists, whose name was Norbert Wiener, and he wrote a book back in the '50s, from before I was even born, called "The Human Use of Human Beings." And in the book, he described the potential to create a computer system that would be gathering data from people and providing feedback to those people in real time in order to put them kind of partially, statistically, in a Skinner box, in a behaviorist system, and he has this amazing line where he says, one could imagine, as a thought experiment — and I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a quote — one could imagine a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on what they did, and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior modification.
I'm certain it's possible.
And I'm certain that the companies, the Googles and the Facebooks, would actually do better in this world.
Yet, she encouraged me to see the world and the issues our world faces as complex, controversial and ever-changing.
One day, I came across the phrase "affirmative action" in a book I was reading.
As a black student attending predominantly white private schools, I've encountered attitudes and behaviors that reflected racial stereotypes.
And it really upset me to think that my race made it harder for them to see me as a student who loved reading, writing and speaking.
Experiences like this motivated me to work tirelessly to disprove what I knew people had assumed.
I was encouraged by my teachers to explore my curiosity, to challenge myself in new ways and to deepen my understanding of subjects that fascinated me the most.
I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors and with outside speakers; to listen, to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself and of others.
I was deeply disappointed by this because, as I saw it, there would be nothing that any of my peers or I could do to silence someone who agreed with him in the office environment of our future employers.
But I did walk away with a deeper understanding.
CA: You might be the person best placed to answer this question, which has puzzled me, which is to shed light on this strange unit of time called "Elon time." For example, last year, I asked Elon, you know, when Tesla would auto-drive across America, and he said by last December, which is definitely true, if you take Elon time into account.
And it comes with the territory of my work. I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet.
He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.
I'm a little bit bigger — I don't like to use the word "fat," but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.
But did our conversation humanize us to each other more than profile pictures and posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there.
DM: You tagged me in this post.
I also want to be super clear about something.
And some have politely declined, others have read my message and ignored it, some have blocked me automatically when I sent the invitation and one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me.
This is an acute question for me, because I'm a prominent advocate of the existence of human nature, with all its shortcomings and perversities.
I remember one morning when I was in the third grade, my mom sent me to school with a Ghanaian staple dish called "fufu." (Laughter)
I'm a first-generation American.
And many of them couldn't understand why I sounded differently than they did or why my parents seemed different than theirs. "Are you even black?" a student asked.
I mean, I thought I was black.
Remember that. "And he would emphasize this, even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be just an American.
Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work as a digital storyteller that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.
I'd gone to see Pete, who was renowned for his workmanship with steel.
That was the epiphany. That was the moment where I was standing in a community hall in a place where this Castlemaine community had given me such support for 20 years, this community had backed my work, I'd played footy there, I'd done theater there, I was so grateful for what they'd given me.
I myself was one of them, and this is what I talk about at the HALT events, that four years ago when I founded HALT, I didn't know I could go to the doctor about my mental health and get a mental health plan.
For example, I can be a good patriot, loyal to my country, and at the same time, be loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty.
But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never underestimate human stupidity.
I'm an MIT professor, but I do not design buildings or computer systems.
Before my legs were amputated, I was a terrible student.
Then, after my limbs were amputated, I suddenly became an MIT professor.
But you know what, that's OK, because at MIT, I already have tenure.
And you may disagree with it, you may think I'm an insufferable fool, you may be bored to death, but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head.
So I decided to quit my job as a university professor to dedicate my life to save more ocean places like this.
Looking for answers, I regret to say, is a lifelong mission, but the key to my being able to persevere is Amy's expressed and very public edict that I must go on.
In the early months following Amy's death, though, I was sure that the feeling of despair would be ever-present, that it would be all-consuming.
We did an opinion poll on this recently, and I was struck to see that most people actually want us to build superintelligence: AI that's vastly smarter than us in all ways. What there was the greatest agreement on was that we should be ambitious and help life spread into the cosmos, but there was much less agreement about who or what should be in charge.
For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.
I'm James. I'm a writer and artist, and I make work about technology.
This is how, within a dozen steps, you can go from a cute video of a counting train to masturbating Mickey Mouse. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. This does get worse.
I'm convinced that we can build cities of difference that help to create the global mosaic to which so many of us aspire.
I looked at my wife, Sadiye; we did some calculating. "About 115 milligrams oxycodone," I responded. "Maybe more." I was nonchalant, having given this information to many doctors many times before, but this time was different.
The prescribers saw me as a complex patient needing specialized care, probably from pain medicine.
I'm sure it wouldn't have been easy.
So, when I went to college in the late 90s, it was obvious that I was going to study aerospace.
Autonomy allows the transportation network to scale, and I actually think it makes the aircraft safer.
And I do think that in a few years, people will be comfortable getting by themselves in a self-piloted, electric, VTOL air taxi.
As a collector of artifacts and as an artist, I really wanted a Klan robe to be part of my collection, because artifacts and objects tell stories, but I really couldn't find one that was really good quality.
I am a product of the American tech industry, both as a consumer and a corporate leader.
I am a biologist and an engineer who builds stuff out of DNA.
I mean, come on, as a scientist looking for a job, doing cutting-edge research, it doesn't get any better than this.
But for now, I would be satisfied beaming new medicines across the globe, fully automated and on demand, saving lives from emerging infectious diseases and printing personalized cancer medicines for those who don't have time to wait.
I asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago?
I believe that we are poised to enter an era where artificial intelligence is going to make an incredible impact on our future.
So I set out to see if this could be done and eventually came up with a new solution that can build a model of a person using nothing but these: existing photos and videos of a person.
As a researcher, I'm also working on countermeasure technology, and I'm part of an ongoing effort at AI Foundation, which uses a combination of machine learning and human moderators to detect fake images and videos, fighting against my own work.
But I'm excited and hopeful, because if we use it right and carefully, this tool can allow any individual's positive impact on the world to be massively scaled and really help shape our future the way we want it to be.
So you take a symbol, any symbol, for example the heart and the arrow, which most of us would read as the symbol for love, and I'm an artist, so I can draw this in any given degree of realism or abstraction.
I've tried to become a better artist by becoming a better observer of images.
Even as a kid, I got angry it was ignoring the laws of physics.
It says that I'm Italian.
I'm Italian, and I love beauty. I love beauty.
It had nothing to do with me. It had more to do with 50, I'm sure, but it has inspired people to think about gardens and sharing each other's worlds in a different way.
Twenty-five years ago, when I was a young pup, very optimistic, we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland, California for the homeless people.
And he looked at me. "For homeless people?" And he didn't give us the money.
And I was taken by the conceptuality of this kind of digital print that sits in a museum in Charleston.
And today, I'm pleased to announce Planet stories.
I came to talk about first principles and communities that I love — especially East Palo Alto, California, which is full of amazing people.
Thank you, Dread Scott, for this opportunity. "" As a veteran defending the flag, I personally would never defend your stupid ass!
As a musician and an engineer, and someone raised in a family of artists, I thought that this idea of musical photographs was really powerful.
But for AIVA, this process is taken from years and years of learning, decades of learning as an artist, as a musician and a composer, down to a couple of hours.
And I couldn't be more proud to show it to you, so if you can, close your eyes and enjoy the music.
A confession: I am an archaeologist and a museum curator, but a paradoxical one.
I believe that the War Gods should be returned.
I grew up in Tucson, Arizona, and fell in love with the Sonoran Desert's past.
We are not returning anything to anyone. "As a college student, all of this was an enigma that was hard to decipher.
I graduated but wasn't sure what to do next, so I traveled.
I had an epiphany. Here was a man who helped a country bridge vast divides to seek, however imperfectly, reconciliation. I'm no Mandela, but I ask myself: Could I, too, plant seeds of hope in the ruins of the past? In 2007, I was hired as a curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
As a storyteller, I've always been fascinated with the idea of recreating this notion of choices in fiction.
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
I am convinced that in the coming years, we will see more and more moving and meaningful interactive experiences, created by a new generation of talents.
What was I supposed to do? Ignore her?
I went from a failing child at school who was constantly told I was lazy and not paying attention to suddenly being a child with opportunity and potential.
I trained in pediatrics (little people) and internal medicine (big people). So one night I might have been on call in the NICU, carefully dosing to the fraction of a milligram a medication for a NICU baby.
I mean, these political movements have built their success with ideas that could mean, down the road, losing my French citizenship because I'm North African or not being able to come back home to the US because I come from a Muslim-majority country.
But it forced me to rethink and rethink this question and try to think deeper.
But I'm sorry to tell you that the facts are not on your side.
It showed another fascinating finding: 71 percent of the world population agreed with the statement, "I am a citizen of the world." Do you know what it means?
I'd been brought in to the company because I was a seasoned expert in my field, but in this particular room, I felt like a newbie amongst the tech geniuses.
I just sat there awkwardly, and mercifully, he moved on to someone else.
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat, so she often sat right next to me in meetings so she could be my tech translator, and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means." Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.
I'll start with a very brief version of how I became a climber, and then tell the story of my two most significant free solos.
After nearly a decade of climbing mostly indoors, I made the transition to the outdoors and gradually started free soloing.
I was slightly rattled, I was pretty rattled, but I tried not to let it bother me too much because I knew that all the hardest climbing was up at the top.
This time I popped over the edge shirtless, panting, jacked.
I was amped, but nobody batted an eye. (Laughter) I looked like a lost hiker that was too close to the edge. I was surrounded by people talking on cell phones and having picnics.
What if I was too tired?
I had to consider every possibility while I was safely on the ground, so that when the time came and I was actually making the moves without a rope, there was no room for doubt to creep in.

They recently came out hard against private prisons in the US, and good for them.

Now I'm a writer, and for my books I like to go on adventures. Go on quests. So I decided I'm going to take my son up on his challenge.
Because I am terrified. But we made it.
So I went to Indiana, and I thanked the steel makers.
We'll be so, "Oh, everything's wonderful, I'm so grateful." Well, it turns out, the opposite is true.

What I'm really here to do today is talk to you about micromanagement and what I learned about micromanagement by being a micromanager over the last few years of my life.
So, I started a company called Boxed in our garage, and this was it — I know it doesn't seem like much — you know, there's a pressure washer in the back — this is "living the dream." And my wife was really proud of me when we started this, or that's what she said, she was really proud of me — and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage; I was picking and packing, doing all the work, but then I graduated to actually managing the people who picked and packed, and then pretty soon I managed the people who managed the people picking and packing.
So I told you. But I really was conflicted, right?
Please, don't leave. Join us. We may not be perfect, but whatever happens, at least you won't be alone.
But admittedly, I'm a weather geek.
And so I woke up one morning, and there was this question in my mind, "Greg, are you engaging in confirmation bias?
And so the more I talked to scientists and read peer-reviewed literature and tried to conduct myself the way I'd been taught to conduct myself at Penn State when I was a student, it became very difficult for me to make the argument that we weren't at least having some effect.
My name is Dan, I'm a partner at a global creative consultancy.
I'm someone who gets really excited about things, so I'd temper that.
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere — In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" — and I got terrified: "What would my bosses think?
Now, I'm lucky.
On a trip back to India, when I was a student in 2012, I took this picture.
I went back to my lab back in Boston and conducted a small experiment.
When this feeling is present, I'm confident that the next phase of healing is on the horizon, and that allows me to share my story in full.
For all appearances' sake, I was born into the ideal family dynamic: mother, father, sister, brother.
Early life experiences had set the stage for me to be well-suited to objectify others, act in a socially detached manner, and above all else, seek to be viewed as in a position of power. A sense of power
One of the best things that happened in my life to that point was being sent to New Folsom Prison.
I realized that as sharp as I believed I was, I didn't even know who I was or why I acted the way that I acted.
Being able to solve puzzles, when I'm confronted with a challenge, has allowed me to explore it from multiple perspectives before I lock in an approach.
When I returned to the United States and entered the airport, a wall of sound hit me.
And I know you're really excited by this picture.
And the first is that I've been writing about manners and civility for more than 20 years, as a book author and as a magazine columnist.
So, speaking of dinner parties, I want to take you back to 2015 and a dinner party that I went to.
