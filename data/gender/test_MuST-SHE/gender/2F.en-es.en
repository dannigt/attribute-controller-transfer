I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house was in flames.

Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average — not everyone, but on average — are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher, Mrs. Posten, who said, "I need to see you.

In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago.
Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go — that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died — already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb — a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
Her mother raised her alone.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And I would look at her and I'd smile, but she was very serious.
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott — amazing African-American woman — and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
Thanks very much. I am Hannah Fry, the badass. And today I'm asking the question: Is life really that complex?
Anne's a transgender female, and as her and I started talking, she was sharing with me about what brought her into treatment, but I could hear this fear in her voice, and I could see this worry in her eyes, and she began to tell me that she didn't fear coming into rehab and having to give up drugs and alcohol.
See, Leah was also assigned male at birth and she knew since she was a young child that she was not a male, that she was a female.
She extended her hand to the doctor and said, "Hi, I'm Leah." The doctor looked at her, didn't shake her hand and said, "Why are you here?" She took another deep breath and said, "Well, I'm a transgender female.
And the opposite is, as we talked earlier, a transgender female, someone that's assigned male at birth but lives their live and sense of self as a female.
She smiled at me a smile only a woman full of knowledge can smile
She wakes up every morning, tired from the night before, baby attached to her breast, dropping this kid off at school, and taking this one to the park.
And she... There was no thinking she wasn't serious when she peered at the audience, and I thought, "Surely she's looking at me." "You know, I'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey.

And I was figuring out how I was going to tell my mother, who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me.
And I thought about what could be done to guide these conversations, and then an amazing colleague of mine, Camilla Gunn, developed a "Working with Cancer" toolkit.
Hi. My name's Sarah, and I've been priced out of the housing market.
Another aspect is where the twisted concept of honor is linked to women and their bodies; where men are allowed to disrespect women and even kill them sometimes in the name of so-called "family honor"; where women are left to die right outside their houses for speaking to a man on a mobile phone, in the name of "family honor." Let me say this very clearly: it's not honor; it's a cold-blooded murder.
I think of the women who do not have the necessary support to deal with the mental trauma when they feel unsafe in online spaces, and they go about their daily activities, thinking that there is a rape threat in their in-box.

Black women are dying in plain sight.
So I have a friend. She's an actress, she's in her 60s. She's super bright, badass, emotionally intelligent.
It was really crowded, as it is around the holidays, and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused. And out of nowhere, someone moved her out of the way — just physically put their hands on her and moved her out of the way.
Maybe he had said something to her, maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it... Either way, she was focused, she was filling out the form. And the next thing you know, there were hands on her, and she was being moved out of the way.
She said that she was shocked at first — yeah.
When women get manhandled, we start to rationalize, try to figure out the ways that it was — "It was probably our fault. You know what? He probably said something, and I didn't hear him.
Women have been trained to think that we are overreacting or that we're being too sensitive or unreasonable. We try to make sense of nonsense, and we swallow the furious feelings.
So my fellow women and our gentle men, as we are here together within this particular window of this large-scale movement towards women's equality, and as we envision a future that does not yet exist, we both have different invitations.
I mean, how did you end up an engineer and President of SpaceX? Were you supernerdy as a girl?
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event, and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think. What's it been like to work so closely with Elon Musk?
I am a wild woman, a rebel singer, a conduit.
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male." But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
She pulls back the covers and makes the gruesome discovery. Vera was dead. When it comes to Spanish flu, those stories are common, of lightning speed deaths.
It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.
Ever since I was a young girl, I was always fascinated —
Things grow, and they grow up and they mature, and it's only by doing so that they can thrive for a very long time. We already know this. If I told you my friend went to the doctor who told her she had a growth that feels very different, because we intuitively understand that when something tries to grow forever within a healthy, living, thriving system, it's a threat to the health of the whole.
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage of the head nurse, Malak, in the aftermath of the bombing, grabbing premature babies out of their incubators, desperate to get them to safety, before she broke down in tears.
So here's how it looks from a banana-peel-universe point of view, from my mindset, which I call "Emily's universe." First of all, I am incredibly grateful for life, but I don't want to be immortal.
The architect Emmanuelle Moureaux uses this idea in her work a lot.
A friend of mine — (Laughter) wants to know if it's possible to get addicted to her vibrator. "The answer is no, but it is possible to get spoiled.
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman, she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things and I was like, 'I want you right now.' And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.' And I was so ready.
Another friend, back in college, told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship.
It's a power play. Leaves her alone. So there's my friend, and she goes, "I'm bored."
And the guy comes back and she says, "I am bored." And he looks at her and he looks at the bar and he says, "Then why are you wet?" Why was she wet?
Your grandmother's dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea. "
I remember on the first day of middle school, my Spanish literature teacher came into the room. She scanned all of my classmates
Then I became an investor, a woman in tech, a teacher.
Now, as for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me. It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there.
One was a British schoolgirl, who had been taken off of a plane at London Heathrow as she was trying to make her way to Syria to join ISIS. And she was 13 years old. So I sat down with her and her father, and I said, "Why?" And she said, "I was looking at pictures of what life is like in Syria, and I thought I was going to go and live in the Islamic Disney World."
And studies have found that if she's pregnant, she doesn't even bother.
But for now, the next time you hear a mosquito buzzing, just pause and remember she may be in love and she may be singing her song, looking for her perfect match.
She was my partner in raising three wonderful, now grown children, and really, she was my girl, you know?
Amy was a prolific author.
Posthumously, the book she wrote with our daughter Paris, called "Dear Girl," reached the number one position on the "New York Times" bestseller list.
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker.
She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children and adults of all ages all over the world.
One friend in particular who had also lost her life partner kept repeating, "Jason, you will find joy." I didn't even know what she was talking about.

When my desperation was clearly coming through my voice, much as it is now, the receptionist took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps what you need is a rehab facility or a methadone clinic." I didn't know any better at the time, so I took her advice.
Last year, a good friend of mine asked me if I would help her with some organization work.
They wanted her piecemealed, papier-mâchéd, practically broken, limp-like and loveless, a litany of exaggeration. They wanted her low. And high. Flat and wide. Filled with all of their empty.
Oh, they wanted her bland. And barren. Unspirited, un-African, uncultured, under siege in the streets.
They wanted her face down, ass up, hands cuffed and ankles strapped.
Oh, they wanted her holy, baptized in her divine, they wanted her secrets, pearls to swine.
Oh, they wanted her complete.
They wanted her whole, though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul, with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.
For wild women are not to be tamed. Only admired. Just let her in and witness her set your days ablaze.
I knew that if in one hour, our child didn't come, I was going to leave her there and go back to work and make a presentation about AI to my boss, Apple's CEO.

She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor.
She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor.
It wasn't so long ago that you could purchase a Teen Talk Barbie that when the cord was pulled, it would say things like, "Will we ever have enough clothes?" and "Math class is tough." And just a few years ago, major retailers were marketing T-shirts at our young girls that read things like, "I'm too pretty to do math," or, "I'm too pretty to do my homework so my brother does it for me."
And I'll be honest: I was a young, naive, Sri Lankan girl,
I choose to be called Mary. As a teacher, I've stood in front of 120 students, so this stage does not intimidate me.
My mother was his second wife, married to him at the age of 16.
I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister.
There, I found my father's first wife, my half sisters and my half brothers.
They said her family did not find it fit for her children, who are all girls, to attend her burial, simply because we were girls.
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.
Sometimes they will jokingly say, "You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become." But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community.
My name is Halima Aden and I'm a black, Muslim, Somali-American from Kenya.
Some have called me a trailblazer — I was the first Muslim homecoming queen at my high school, the first Somali student senator at my college and the first hijab-wearing woman in many places, like the Miss Minnesota USA beauty pageant, the runways of Milan and New York Fashion Weeks and even on the historic cover of British "Vogue." As you can see, I'm not afraid to be the first, to step out on my own, to take risks and seek change, because that's what being a minority is about.
Some of the people said, "I'm a German girl.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern. It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis, and it's clear to me that she's not clinically depressed, and I tell her that.
But she isn't reassured. "It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.
She says," I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
But at the same time, her mind is pushing away, because she remembers there are all these other parts to her identity — other relationships, her work, hobbies, a spiritual and intellectual life, not to mention physical needs: to sleep, to eat, to exercise, to have sex, to go to the bathroom, alone —
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence, if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull, if they knew that under these circumstances, ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of, they would feel less alone, they would feel less stigmatized, and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter, who did all my illustrations. (Cheers and applause) Yeah.
Her daughter's been taken hostage by an android, and of course, she's in a state of shock.
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the threesome."
These two Kenyan ladies were best friends from neighboring villages, but they'd stopped seeing each other, literally, for 10 years, because both had gone blind from a curable condition called cataracts.
But in that very same clinic, I met Theresa, a shy young woman who couldn't look me in the eyes, not because she couldn't see, but the appearance of the growth on her eyes called pterygium meant she'd lost her confidence, and with it, her place in her community.
She had no prospects for marriage or children and had been completely ostracized.
Terrified that Natasha was going to lose her grandmother, she went with him.
She was grabbed from behind, and she felt what she thought was a gun, in her side.
Each of those women had a rape kit done.
One of those white Republican women in Charlotte was a waitress struggling to stay awake with an enormous Big Gulp soda. She just looked exhausted. And she was. She told us that she worked two jobs but still could not afford a membership to the Y, but it was OK that she couldn't go to the gym, she said, because she also could not afford gas and walked 10 miles to and from work every single day.
And my family survived, but we teetered, down one paycheck, relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary.
Our story is about a girl named Iris.
But one day, she meets a girl named Onion.
Onion looks gorgeous in her bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific.
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group.
Prisoner two also sees an odd number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly.
Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for an even number of black hats since one was behind her.
I'm just going to keep — yeah, thanks, mom. (Applause) She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, "Niels, it's hard.
That's our dog, by the way. Isn't she cute?
And one of them started crying — her name is Yahara. She started crying. I said, "Why are you crying?" She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe — always seeing us represented as poor people — I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.
Now, when she was contacted by this reporter, her identity was known. She was exposed. And when she was exposed, she received a demotion, death threats, over collegiate sports.
As a white, cisgendered woman in the United States, there are many ways I'm very privileged.
I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead amongst the millennials, and I quickly learned that I had as much to offer them as they did to me.
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat, so she often sat right next to me in meetings so she could be my tech translator, and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means." Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10. And that leaves a few of you in this audience as potential victims. You want to know what's even more alarming?
And that's what I was wondering last fall when I was working at U of T's planetarium, and I was contacted by an artist named Robyn Rennie and her daughter Erin.
And Robyn was so moved by this presentation that when she went home, she painted this gorgeous representation of her experience.
I know someone who overdosed, who was revived by Narcan, and she was mostly angry that she wasn't simply allowed to die.
Belle Gibson was a happy young Australian.
But Belle was determined.
She'd been a fighter her whole life.
And girls are telling me that they're especially worried about their futures.
That's the number of women who were married before their 18th birthday.
Six hundred and fifty million. And many were mothers while they were still children themselves.
And in this program, girls who have been studying computer skills and the STEM program have a chance to work side by side with young professionals, so that they can learn firsthand what it's like to be an architect, a designer or a scientist.
And when you see these girls, smiles on their faces, the hot lights in their eyes, they are so excited, they have hope for the future.
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament as one of the first women with a minority background. I was elected, but I soon found out that not everyone was happy about it as I had to quickly get used to finding hate messages in my inbox.

So a friend of mine was riding in a taxi to the airport the other day, and on the way, she was chatting with the taxi driver, and he said to her, with total sincerity, "I can tell you are a really good person." And when she told me this story later, she said she couldn't believe how good it made her feel, that it meant a lot to her.
Now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger, but she's not alone.
Like, for example, when I got an email from a female student in my class saying that a reading I had assigned, a reading I had been assigning for years, was sexist.
Well, let me introduce you to my friend Cayla.
When we confronted the company that made and programmed Cayla, they issued a series of statements that one had to be an IT expert in order to breach the security. Shall we fact-check that statement and live hack Cayla together? Here she is. Cayla is equipped with a Bluetooth device which can transmit up to 60 feet, a bit less if there's a wall between.
For example, a comedy about a high school senior, who, when faced with an unplanned pregnancy, makes an unusual decision regarding her unborn child.
They were scripts like "Juno" and "Little Miss Sunshine" and "The Queen" and "The King's Speech" and "Spotlight." And yes, "Slumdog Millionaire." And even an upcoming movie about Michael Jackson's chimpanzee.
That our onscreen heroes have to conform to a very narrow idea about beauty that we consider conventional. What does that mean when those images are projected 30 feet high and the lights go down, for a kid that looks like me in Columbus, Georgia? Or a Muslim girl in Cardiff, Wales?
Professor Juliana Schroeder at UC Berkeley and her colleagues have research that suggests that listening to someone's voice as they make a controversial argument is literally humanizing.

Sophie pretends to be ill so she doesn't have to go to school.
And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind with her schoolwork.
Storybook Dads began in 2003, when Sharon Berry, a civilian worker in a prison, realized just how much many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children.
My tías were cops and paramedics, my abuelas were seamstresses and sold jewelry up the street, and my mom got her master's degree in education and taught kindergarten in New York City public schools for over 30 years.
And I don't know how much time you've spent with Puerto Rican women from the Bronx, but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers.
The funny, the goofy, the gentle — those were my in to storytelling, so much so that I wrote a young-adult novel called "Juliet Takes a Breath," about a chubby, queer Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx navigating sexuality, family and identity.
She's tough, Latina, and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.
And I saw that, right? And also, when I looked at America, I saw a young Latina in survival mode.
See, because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe when she was a kid, and she'd been on her own ever since.
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft on her own.
Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated but a university dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States?
And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You," and America is so excited, she's ready to show off her strength, she's ready to show off her portal-punching skills,
But I didn't want America to be alone for long, and so in a homework assignment gone totally wrong, she lands on a battlefield with the X-Men.
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong, luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above.
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
I talked about this in front of an environmentalist just the other day, and she said, "Why are you defending humans?
One of my favorite senior clients — we'll call her Jane — is a poster child for what's old-fashioned in leadership today.
For example, my friend Lisa, she cuts her hair a certain length, so she feels the vibrations of sound in the music.
It's about the 60 percent of black girls like me who will be experiencing sexual violence before they turn 18, and the thousands and thousands of low-wage workers who are being sexually harassed right now on jobs that they can't afford to quit.
Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated and told they don't belong.
Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party.
Some of the first domestic workers in the United States were black women who were enslaved, and racial exclusion has shaped their conditions for generations.
One day, she saw an article in a newspaper about another domestic worker with a really similar story to hers, another case that I was working on at the time, and she found a way to reach me.
She was essentially enslaved for 15 years.
As you go about your day and you encounter these moral choices, think of Lily. Think like Lily. Think like a domestic worker who shows up and cares no matter what.
I stand here today for the first time since I was 14 years old not under any form of state supervision. I'm married to a tremendous woman named Holly, and together, we are raising two sons who I encourage to experience emotions in a safe way.
To Kat and Marie, not having and election website was unacceptable, but they didn't have very many options.They didn't have the budget to hire a web developer, they didn't have the expertise to build a site themselves, so they went without.
Inspired by their experience, we built a website template using research-based best practices in civic design, and developed the training so that Kat and Marie are able to maintain their site themselves.
The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire: Madam C. J. Walker... The dresses of the first ladies of the United States... Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek the US Democratic party's presidential nomination —
Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational.
If we can collectively apply that radical notion that women are people, it becomes easier to show women as people are: familiar, diverse, present.
Demands for the increase of women's representation does not automatically include Afro-Latinas like me... or immigrant women, or Asian women, or Native women, or trans women, or undocumented women, or women over 65, or girls — the list can go on and on and on.

That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.
And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer Mahasweta Devi died, our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit.
And one day, you get an in-app notification and it says that your favorite actress has written a sexy short story and it's waiting for you.
But the amazing thing is, even though my mother's own grandmother could not vote in Texas, because under Texas law, "idiots, imbeciles, the insane and women" were prevented the franchise — just two generations later, my mother, Ann Richards, was elected the first woman governor in her own right in the state of Texas. (Applause and cheers) But you see, when Mom was coming up in Texas, there weren't a lot of opportunities for women, and frankly, she spent her entire life trying to change that.
Economists even estimate that if every single paid working woman took just one day off of work, it would cost the United States 21 billion dollars in gross domestic product.
Women around the world, as we know, are raising their hands and saying, "Me Too," and it's a movement that's made so much more powerful by the fact that women are standing together across industries, from domestic workers to celebrities in Hollywood.
She took on six men in her primary, she beat them all, she won the general election, and when she goes to Congress in January, she's going to be the first African-American woman ever to serve her district in Washington, D.C. (Applause and cheers) So women are recognizing — this is our moment. Don't wait for permission, don't wait for your turn.
As the late, great Shirley Chisholm said — Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever to go to Congress and the first woman to run for president in the Democratic party — but Shirley Chisholm said, "If there's no room for you at the table, just pull up a folding chair." And that's what women are doing, all across the country.
Mom was having issues with memory loss and accepting her age. She looked defeated. I tried to make her as comfortable as possible, but when I was at my easel, painting, I would peek over and see her just... there.
At a young age, her father died of pneumonia, leaving his wife and two daughters alone with all the heavy chores.
Mom, the oldest, at 13, was married off to a complete stranger twice her age.
She went from being just a kid and was pushed into adulthood.
She felt worthy again, she felt wanted and needed.
I also gave Mom a project to do, to keep her busy and thinking.
Our fight lasted less than two minutes, but it was a perfect reflection of the hurricane that was building inside of me as a young survivor of sexual assault and as a girl who was grappling with abandonment and exposure to violence in other spaces in my life.
A teacher broke up the fight and my principal called me in her office.
Believing that a girl is older than she is can lead to harsher treatment, immediate censure when she makes a mistake and victim blaming when she's harmed.
Qualities that are often measured in relation to nonblack girls and which don't take into consideration what's going on in this girl's life or her cultural norms.
Middle school girls are being turned away from school because of the way they wear their hair naturally or because of the way the clothes fit their bodies. High school girls are experiencing violence at the hands of police officers in schools. Where can black girls be black without reprimand or punishment?
She bypasses the neuroscientific and structural analyses that science has to offer about how her adverse childhood experiences inform why she's participating in violence and goes straight to describing herself as a "problem child," largely because that's the language that educators were using as they routinely suspended her.
And as a result, their truancy and suspension rates have improved, and girls are arriving at school increasingly ready to learn because they know the teachers there care about them. That matters.
If we commit to this notion of education as freedom work, we can shift educational conditions so that no girl, even the most vulnerable among us, will get pushed out of school.
Two hundred and fourteen million women in lower-income countries say they want to decide whether and when to become pregnant but aren't using contraception.
She'd come across a few snippets of my memoir, which wasn't even out yet, and she was concerned.
I was raised there in part by my grandmother who worked as a domestic, and by my sister, who adopted me a few years after our mother, who struggled with mental illness, disappeared.
She was the only other person who seemed as strange as me, beautifully strange, some mix of Blanche DuBois from "A Streetcar Named Desire" and a 1980s Whitney Houston.
I'm not saying she was perfect,
An angry black woman? Or a crazy white one? You can pick. But in fact, the effect is that when we say what's important to us, which is what anger is conveying, people are more likely to get angry at us for being angry.
I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired.
I engaged many women and girls to work with me. It was hard. Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married, because their husbands wouldn't let them work.
One colleague of mine was given away by her family to make amends for a crime her brother had committed.
Men told me that, "You women, elected women members, should buy sewing machines for women." When I knew what they needed the most was access to clean drinking water.
All these elected women now share, discuss and resolve their problems together.
Let me tell you about two of the women I have been working with: Saira Shams.
You can see, this young lady, age 26, she ran for a public office in 2015 in Lower Dir, and she won.
And another young woman is Asma Gul.
She was unable to run for the public office, so she has become the first female journalist of our region.
But I don't want any girl or any woman to take 23 years of her life to make herself heard.
That might not come as a surprise to some of you. I look like a woman. I'm dressed like one, I guess.
But then, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander, she invited us over to the Russian segment.
She's a resident, a surgeon in training.
And she lets him do the final line of sutures. Kristen feels great. Patient ’ s going to be fine, and no doubt she ’ s a better surgeon than she was at 6: 30.
But he also knows she ’ d be slower and make more mistakes, and his patient comes first.
I spoke with Dr. Lori Brotto, a psychologist who treats sexual issues in women, including survivors of trauma
She says the hundreds of women she sees all tend to repeat the same thing. They say, "I don't feel whole." They feel they've lost a connection with their partners and themselves.
And in many ways, although I was a typical 12-year-old girl, my ambivalence about my education led to pretty average grades.
As a former research librarian and an educator, my mother knew that I was capable of accomplishing a lot more.
So we have no appointments; she shows up when she wants, but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen.
She is a hard worker and spent 10 to 12 hours every day rolling bidis.
As a second daughter of my conservative Indian family, I was fairly clear from a very early age that no one expected anything from me.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
My father was confused, my mother was worried — (Applause) My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
Well, six months ago, we had a new joinee. Her name is Kaviarasi.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.
I first traveled there in 2003, and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.
And that's also because women are used to taking care of people, so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia, but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.
And then they want to put on some music, and maybe order some food, and now, they are barking orders at an obedient female voice assistant.
We need women to be the makers and not just the machines who do the makers' bidding.
