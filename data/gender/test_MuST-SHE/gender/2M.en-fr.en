And, one day, he came in to my session — exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions — and he said to me, "Wow.
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation, so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones, and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that, he had to be the bearer — this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk, and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence, and you've been making liar out of me ever since." (Laughter) (Applause)
What that means is if you met somebody, and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall," how much would you know about his height?
So, I started a company with Stan Winston, my good friend Stan Winston, who is the premier make-up and creature designer at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
The day before the event, I called the head of P.R. for the company. Let's call him Don.
Let's call him Miguel — actually his name is Miguel. (Laughter) And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef, at least in the way that you and I understand it.
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish.
I'm an expert in relationships. "And then he's off, launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants.
Look to Miguel, farmers like Miguel. Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves; farms that restore instead of deplete; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively; farmers that are not just producers, but experts in relationships. Because they're the ones that are experts in flavor, too.
Truly. This is a portrait by photographer Phil Toledano.
And he says, "We're witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments." And he's an economist
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music.
And I'm telling a story that many of you know, because Steve's columns became the basis for a book, which was turned into a movie, with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez, and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the Juilliard-trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
The redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him, that recognized his talents and respected him.
A kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago. Think about that, it's an incredible fact.

When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex Luther — (Laughter) got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog! I was stunned with jealousy.

The great 20th-century geneticist, T.G. Dobzhansky, who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church, once wrote an essay that he titled "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution." Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution, this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid, take out your personal communications device — I give you permission — and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong, because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you. (Laughter) But if you do accept biological evolution, consider this: is it just about the past, or is it about the future?
Now if you take this picture — I'm Italian originally, and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom — but the reason I'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades.
My colleague at MIT, Assaf Biderman, he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing, but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning, and that's actuating our environment.

And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were very interested in science, and they were interested in the concept of a naturalistic world.
If we look at one of the Founding Fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, he offers us something of a solution in his "I have a dream" speech.
We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example, where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered, unless he's willing to submit to a sex change, in which case he's allowed to live.
I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with — a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.
A friend of mine did that — Richard Bollingbroke.
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys' room, until one teacher saved my life.
Just as a simple example, in 1987, we thought this guy was kind of crazy.

And as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse, there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse.
When this man saw me, he came over to me and he said, "Who are you?" I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said, "You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir." And this man came over to me and he hugged me.

In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode.
Sixty years later, Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to the 5 / 3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems in physics.
At the end of the experiment, he was struggling to concentrate, had trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating.
So what happens to a transgender male — for a quick recap, that's someone who is assigned female at birth but lives their life as a male — what happens when this transgender male goes for their yearly gynecological visit?

Mr. Smith, one of my former colleagues, uses Scott McCloud's "Understanding Comics" in his literature and film class, because that book gives his students the language with which to discuss the relationship between words and images.
Having completed the course, the student fed back to us that he now realized that it was he who hadn't understood what the client wanted.
Our chief technology officer is an English major, and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan.
But the funny thing about Adam Smith is that he was a stay-at-home kind of guy.

And I suppose I could mention from one of the very earliest computer scientists, whose name was Norbert Wiener, and he wrote a book back in the '50s, from before I was even born, called "The Human Use of Human Beings." And in the book, he described the potential to create a computer system that would be gathering data from people and providing feedback to those people in real time in order to put them kind of partially, statistically, in a Skinner box, in a behaviorist system, and he has this amazing line where he says, one could imagine, as a thought experiment — and I'm paraphrasing, this isn't a quote — one could imagine a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on what they did, and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior modification.
Now, this little boy here, Pamelo, from Zambia, he has trachoma.
A colleague and I were traveling in a very remote village, and we asked an old man to take us down into a little tomb.
In fact, President Carter, he talks about how trachoma was a real problem in Georgia when he was a little boy.

I've had men stand up and say, "I've never mentioned before that I've had depression, but I have, and if anyone else here wants to come and speak to me, I'm here to talk to you." It's very empowering and cathartic to do that.

When she pushed him and said, "You know, he's really quite badly off," the doctor responded, "Well, if it's that bad, he can just go back to his previous dose for a little while."
Sadiye got back on the phone with the prescriber and this time he recommended that we contact our pain management team from the last hospitalization.
Furious, we called the prescriber back and begged him for anything — anything that could help me — but instead he apologized, saying that he was out of his depth. "Look," he told us, "my initial advice to you is clearly bad, so my official recommendation is that Travis go back on the medication until he can find someone more competent to wean him off."

I think you do have too much trouble about this flag. "" I think that the artist should be returned to his heritage, i.e., the jungles of Africa, and then he can shovel manure in his artistic way. "" This flag I'm standing on stands for everything oppressive in this system: the murder of the Indians and all the oppressed around the world, including my brother who was shot by a pig, who kicked over his body to 'make sure the nigger was dead.' That pig was wearing the flag.

The tallest captive sees three black hats in front of him, so he says "black," telling everyone else he sees an odd number of black hats.
Prisoner three sees an even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be one of the black hats the first two prisoners saw.

He is one of the two scientists credited with discovering phages.
He was interested in a disease called bacillary dysentery, which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea, and back then, was actually killing a lot of people, because after all, no cure for bacterial infections had been invented.
He took the sample, filtered it until he was sure that only something very small could have remained, and then took a tiny drop and added it to freshly cultivated bacteria.
But I loved talking to this inventor, Doug Fleming, because he was so passionate.
In my book, though, I argue that the first modern crisis of civility actually began about 500 years ago, when a certain professor of theology named Martin Luther took advantage of a recent advancement in communications technology, the printing press, to call the Pope the Antichrist, and thus inadvertently launch the Protestant Reformation.
Now, he told me that he'd always felt overwhelmed by his job, but it wasn't until our conversation that he thought it might be because of the technologies he was overseeing.
A colleague of mine took a ride in a Lyft in Atlanta last year, and he started chatting with his driver about libraries, as we do.
Is it so far-fetched to imagine a society in which people are arrested based on their thoughts of committing a crime, like in the science-fiction dystopian society in "Minority Report." Already, in the United States, in Indiana, an 18-year-old was charged with attempting to intimidate his school by posting a video of himself shooting people in the hallways... Except the people were zombies and the video was of him playing an augmented-reality video game, all interpreted to be a mental projection of his subjective intent.

And for two hours, he and I sat there and talked about life, and I got to ask him to forgive me for my hand in his death.
Three months later, he was executed by the State of Mississippi.
And when I talked to him, he was genuinely upset about our decision.
Bill said he had this crushing depression for weeks, and when he went back to work, his colleagues would say things to him like, "Hey, did you fry him?" To them, it was just a joke.
The final juror that I spoke to was Ken.
When we sat down to talk, it was apparent that he was deeply saddened by what we were required to do.
He relived the day that he left the courthouse and he drove home and he went to put his key in his door and unlock it, and he said he literally broke down.
He said he knew that Bobby was guilty, but the decision he made, he did not know if it was the right decision.
And he had just said he did not have time for total political correctness, and he did not believe the country did either.
Because then, a few months later, he came to my door, my front door, in a rage and tried to break the door down.
And then there was the hospital that continued to bill a dead man.

And that's also because women are used to taking care of people, so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia, but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.
Now during medieval times, diseased, dead bodies were sometimes catapulted over walls as an early form of biological warfare, and it's speculated that today, humans are being propelled over the wall as a form of immigration. A ridiculous idea. But the only person ever known to be documented to have launched over the wall from Mexico to the United States was in fact a US citizen, who was given permission to human-cannonball over the wall, 200 feet, so long as he carried his passport in hand
For example, rich white women are probably much better off in society than poor white men, and rich black men are probably somewhere in between.
Many years ago I was working on Hubble Space Telescope, and a scientist I worked with came to me with some data, and he said, "I think there may be a picture of a planet orbiting another star in this data." We had not had any pictures taken of planets orbiting other stars yet, so if this were true, then this would be the first one and we would be the ones who found it.
