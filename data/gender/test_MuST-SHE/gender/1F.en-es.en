Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward, but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me.
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing, because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity, and I'm going to make an admission: This phrase never sat right with me, and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it, and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania, and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes. It was summertime: I had shorts on.
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time, in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old, if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs, I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
Not like me, I'm a game designer; I'm exuberant.
AB: I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me.
But before I show you what I've got inside, I'm going to make a very public confession, and that is, I'm outfit-obsessed.
I've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.
I'm a historian by training, and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy — meaning human bodies, animal bodies — how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies; how have they thought about bodies.
The other hat that I've worn in my work is as an activist, as a patient advocate — or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate — for people who are patients of doctors.
I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
It makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
So in order to tell you about that tension, I have to first admit to you a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
I also want to point out that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans, because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies, particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
For years, because I've been interested in intersex, I've also been interested in sex-difference research.
Years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my graduate advisors who knew I was interested in feminism — I considered myself a feminist, as I still do, asked a really strange question.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs. I was in awe.
My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me
I'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults. Could you please come to Ohio, and please bring that man that I know you have found by now.
My ethics of seeing is informed by 25 years as a reporter covering emerging economies and international relations.
And I said to her, "I was looking forward to going to developing countries and doing research and covering stories at the same time." She said, "I don't think so, girlfriend." And that confusion, that mutual confusion, drove us to publish a paper on the conflicting ethics and the contradictory practices of research and reporting.
Well, as a reporter, if I hang a microphone on someone, that is consent.
And when it comes to creating the story, I'll fact-check as a reporter, but I don't invite company to create that story, whereas social scientists, researchers, and particularly participatory researchers, will often work on constructing the narrative with the community.
I will continue to work as a researcher and a reporter in developing countries, but I do it with an altered ethic of seeing.
So when I ask you a question, since I'm blind, only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories. (Laughter) Otherwise, when I ask you a question, and if your answer is yes, I'd like you to clap your hands.
I found myself becoming a little bit of a technophobe.
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities.
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble.
When I was a child, I had multiple collections of sticks and stones and pebbles and shells.
In one, I was the classic Asian student, relentless in the demands that I made on myself.
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious, tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student, I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another, and their edges didn't fit.
This may sound strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
I'm a researcher at the MIT Media Lab, part of the Opera of the Future group, and my research focuses on the relationship people have with their own voice and with the voices of others.
Those are my students, and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher, I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice.
So I'm all excited, I start driving to work, and the more I drive, the scareder I get.
Nobody will ever know I was thinking it if I don't say it. "But it wouldn't let me go, because God loves to show up as us, and because I look broken and I'm always called to stand in my wholeness, there was a call on my life to say this thing out loud.
I get to decide what the greatest vision of myself looks like.
As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment that we can put over the side of the research vessel, and it measures oxygen and many more things.
I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that. (Laughter) And I do solid science, I publish my results, my colleagues read them, I get citations of my work.
But I truly believe that, as a scientist, using mostly federal funds to do the research, I owe it to the public, to agency heads and congressional people to share my knowledge with them so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions about our environmental policy.
You see, I'm a lawyer and I needed some evidence.
That it would be my coworkers and my job that would make me feel valuable and human at times when I would have otherwise felt like a statistic.
But while I was ready for all the physical side effects, what really scared me was this thing called chemo brain.
And if this happened to me, I wondered how I was going to do my job as a lawyer. Would I be forced to leave work? And how could I possibly have a discussion with my manager about reasonable adjustments to my working arrangements when I didn't know how I was going to be impacted?
Frankly, I felt trapped.
To get my law degree, of course, it was really difficult, and [there were] frowns of disapproval.
And even when I was married, this tool became a tool for my own surveillance.
When I resisted this idea of being surveilled by my ex-husband, he really didn't approve of this and threw me out of his house, along with my six-month-old son, Abdullah.
I felt loved by my entire family and my neighbors.
As a college student, I went on an expedition across the Atlantic with a team of scientists using a high-powered laser to measure microscopic algae.
I am convinced that the discoveries awaiting us in the twilight zone will be just as breathtaking.
So I'm a scientist who studies life in the ocean.
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, I'm really fortunate to be surrounded by colleagues who share this passion.
And she went on to say, "I mean, I wanted to get physical. I don't know — I was furious.
That's lifetimes of women dealing with men who assume they know better for us than we know for ourselves, being the property of husbands, landowners, and having old, white men tell us the fate of our lady parts; lifetimes of having our bodies used for love and objects of desire, instead of bodies that we get to wield and use as we choose.
It was the first time we flew it, and the star of the show, of course, brother and sister side boosters landing. I was excited.
GS: I don't think I was nerdy, but I was definitely doing the things that the girls weren't doing.
And I used to shy away from telling that story, but if that's what caused me to be an engineer — hey, I think we should talk about that.
So I think it was helpful for me to be an engineer.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.
I don't think I'm dumb enough to do something for 16 years that I don't like doing.
But then once I realized that that's his job, and my job is to get the company close to comfortable so he can push again and put us back on that slope, then I started liking my job a lot more, instead of always being frustrated.
I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster. (Laughter) CA: That's certainly amazing. (Laughter) GS: I'm personally invested in this one, because I travel a lot and I do not love to travel, and I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh, leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.
So as a victims' rights attorney fighting to increase the prospect of justice for survivors across the country and as a survivor myself, I'm not here to say, "Time's Up." I'm here to say, "It's time." It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence.
I saw it firsthand when I was a university professor.
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s when I first heard those shocking facts and the scientist in me wanted to know why and how.
Well, it actually goes back to my time as a professor.
After all, I was a scientist, I came from the world under attack, and I had personally felt the outrage.
When I was hired by the Free Library in 2013, I specifically chose to work at McPherson because I understand what it's like to grow up in an environment where substance use disorder shapes the everyday, and I wanted to use those personal experiences as a guide for my work.
Excited, I bounced to my feet and flipped three more cartwheels before landing by her side.
I'm a Harvard Business School professor, but I was super attracted to going to an organization that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire.
Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps,
I have been tempted at every step of my career, tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world.
I'm not an engineer. I did not study engineering in school. But I was a super ambitious student growing up.
In middle school and high school, I had straight A's, and I graduated at the top of my year.
Since this product would be readily interacting with the body, it had to be biocompatible, it also had to be low-cost, as I was designing it and paying for it myself.
So when IDA asked for help, I decided to launch CanDo seven months early, with very little money, and many people, including myself, thought I had finally gone mad.
I have this — not a scientist myself — but an uncanny ability to understand everything about science, except the actual science — (Laughter)
A headline from the Los Angeles Times: "Anne Frank: Not so nice after all." (Laughter) Plus, I love being in sync with the cyclical rhythms of the universe.
I think they'll find me delicious. (Laughter)
I don't have to use the executive brain function... Ha, ha, ha, I win! (Laughter) And I am so grateful to you. I don't want to say "the audience," because I don't really see it as we're two separate things.
So it's my turn and I'm standing next to my table, everything neatly lined up, and I'm just hoping that my professors can see how much effort I've put into making my designs practical and ergonomic and sustainable.
And I'm starting to get really nervous, because for a long time, no one says anything.
But I was also kind of intrigued, because joy is this intangible feeling, and how does that come from the stuff on the table next to me?
I felt like a detective.
My specialty, as a sex educator, is I bring the science.
Thank you so much. I know that you do this all the time, and yet, still, I'm so grateful to you for having the courage to come and talk about that on this stage.
It really took a lot and we're very grateful to you. So thank you. Emily Nagoski: I am grateful to be here.
I was born in Korea — the land of kimchi; raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow by now; and I was educated in the US
During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian, but my looks betrayed me at times.
She scanned all of my classmates, and she said, "You — you have to get a tutor, otherwise, you won't pass this class." But by then I was fluent in Spanish already, so it felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian, but not both.
And so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian, but too Argentinian to be Korean.
So with this realization in mind, I decided to embrace all of the different versions of myself — even allow myself to reinvent myself at times.
So for example, in high school, I have to confess I was a mega-nerd.
It's more about allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating diversity within me and not just around me.
And I'm sitting there in this makeshift prison in the north of Iraq with this 23-year-old who had actually trained as a suicide bomber before defecting.
But I'm a biomedical engineer, and perhaps the application I like the most is in the medical field, and it's very difficult to imagine a closer interaction with the human body than actually going inside the body, for example, to perform a minimally invasive procedure.
Well, I'm a science journalist and multimedia producer, who has always been fascinated by gross stuff.
To explain what I mean, why don't I tell you a little bit about what I was like as a child?
Now, the fact that I was obsessed with gross stuff as a kid is not so revolutionary. You know, lots of kids are really into gross things, like playing in dirt or collecting beetles or eating their boogers. And why is that?
I'm a forensic developmental psychologist, and I study these types of cases.
As a researcher, a professor and a new parent, my goal is to conduct scientific research that helps us understand how kids function in a legal system that was designed for adults.
People were very angry about how Brendan was questioned, and many assumed that his interrogation had to have been illegal. It wasn't illegal. As someone who's a researcher in this area and is familiar with police interrogation training manuals, I wasn't really surprised by what I saw.
As a parent and as a researcher, I think we can do better.
When I was a kid, I was, like many of you in this room, very much fascinated by Star Wars, and what fascinated me the most is this notion of the Force, this energy that connects all people and all objects and allows you to feel people that you can't even see.
And I remember many nights, I would be sitting at home, just, like, concentrating and focusing, trying to feel the Force, and I didn't feel anything, don't worry. (Laughter) And later in life, I became a scientist.
I'm sure many of you have seen this picture.
So I'm really excited because we have deployed the device with many patients.
So when I started, I told you that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars and the Force in Star Wars, and indeed, I'm still very much fascinated, even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars, waiting for the next movie.
But I'm very fascinated now and excited about this new Force of wireless signals, and the potential of changing health care with this new force.
She has heart failure, and I'm sure many of you guys in the audience have parents, grandparents, loved ones who have chronic diseases.
So glad you're breathing.
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.
I wrote it because I was tired of pretending I was all right when I wasn't.
I was tired of faking normal.
Even as I was coming out, I was still hiding.
I'm ready now to link shields with others, to fight this fight, and I'm inviting you to join me.
A few things you should know about me: I'm an action-oriented overachieving math and theater nerd, who ended up with an MBA.
But two minutes in, I could tell it wasn't going to be a thing and I was relieved not to be spending dinner with him.
After that, I was a little nervous about going to my next zero date.
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor, planning to save the world.
Katie has been raped and her lifeless body has been found in the woods three days later, after her disappearance.
And I'm really, really thrilled that after nine years of intense research, as of 2017, we are able to contribute to police investigations.
on the grounds — Reserve Bank said that we cannot issue a license to the bank whose promoting members who are nonliterate. I was terrified. I was crying. And by coming back home, I was continuously crying.
When I was pregnant with my first child, I was always hungry. I did not have enough food to eat.
I am just — I couldn't be more proud of her.
I am so lucky that I'm working with these women.
20 years before — and I'm so proud — we went to Reserve Bank of India and we set up the first rural women's bank.
Growing up, I was an avid athlete.
My main sport was soccer, and I was a goalkeeper, which is both the best and the worst position on the field.
In a matter of seconds, I went from playing at the top to the bottom of my ability. Just knowing that I was being evaluated changed my performance and forever how I thought about the mental aspect of how we perform.
All of a sudden the ball seemed to go in slow motion, and I was fixated on my every move.
Even though I studied for my first midterm exam — I thought I was ready to go — I bombed it.
I was convinced I wasn't going to be a science major, that maybe I was dropping out of college altogether.
But when I walked into the final, my mind was quiet, and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class.
So what I did was, I began to develop that acrostic poem into a full training entitled "I'm G.R.A.C.E.D." Because I remember, being the front-desk specialist, and when I went to the office of equity to start working, I was like, "Is that why they asked us to ask that question?" It all became a bright light to me, and I realized that I asked people and I told people about — I called them by the wrong gender, I called them by the wrong race, I called them by the wrong ethnicity, and the environment became hostile, people was offended and I was frustrated because I was not graced.
I was always fascinated by things that moved, catching small animals, holding them in my hands, feeling the magic of their movement; playing with fire, thrilled and terrified at its unrelenting force, accidentally burning my father's barn down — just once.
When I was 27 years old, I found myself in a rat-infested New York City loft, getting ready to hurl myself off a ladder.
We reached as far up as heaven that day, I'm pretty sure of it.
Looking back, I am extremely grateful for the positive response that I received, not only from academia, but also patients, and people around the world affected by this terrible disease.
And I am confident that with the right collaborations, we will beat this terrible disease.
I have to tell you, I was a little bit hurt. (Laughter) I mean, he wanted to do a book with my students and not with me, but OK, it's all right.
Education shall be your first husband. "And with these words came in his first big investment. I felt lucky!
I was alone, in school, when I heard of her death.
I've never felt so stuck.
But then, in 2012, life took away the only thing that I was clinging on. My father died. My grades in school started to collapse, and when I sat for my final high school exams in 2015, I was devastated to receive a C grade.
OK, I keep telling students in my class, "It's not about the A's; it's about doing your best." That was not my best. I was determined. I wanted to go back and try again.
And that is who we are, my sisters and I. And I'm so proud of that.
As a teacher, I see my classroom as a laboratory that not only generates skills and knowledge but also understanding and hope.
I began by saying that I am a teacher.
I made friends with the kids at the camp and even started embracing some of their cultures, celebrating holidays like Christmas even though I was raised Muslim.
Being a child refugee has taught me that one could be stripped of everything: food, shelter, clean drinking water, even friendship, but the one thing that no one could ever take away from you is your education.
When I first started wearing it, I was excited.
But when I started middle school, the students teased me about not having hair, so to prove them wrong, I started showing them my hair — something that goes against my beliefs, but something I felt pressured to do.
I didn't know other failed entrepreneurs, and I thought I was the only loser in the world.
When I was a Child Protective Services worker, I saw things like this all the time.
Now, as social work faculty at Florida State University, I lead an institute that curates the most innovative and effective child welfare research.
I actually started to see some of this growing evolution and awareness myself cropping up all over China.
Secretly, I was terrified.
I stayed in my home for a year, thinking I did something wrong, told myself, "What did you do? What happened?" I stayed silent, while all along, I went outside and smiled. Nobody knew. That's money shame.
I'm that friend.
Well, today, I'm an executive speechwriter for one of the biggest companies in the world.
As a biologist and a geneticist, it has become my mission to help solve this problem.
I know it sounds nerdy, but you know I'm a scientist.
I'm a psychiatrist who works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern. It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
It is time to ask ourselves, have the assumptions and policies we developed in the wake of those tragic events truly made us more secure? Have they made our societies, both in Europe and in the United States, more resilient? I've worked all my life in the field of security and defense, and I am convinced that now, more than ever, we need to radically reframe the way we think and act about security, and especially about international security.
My broken pelvis and I were now facing six weeks on the couch, and I would have gone absolutely insane if it hadn't been for my friends.
Spontaneous parties broke out at my house every night for weeks. I was fed. I was entertained. It was great. But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of hard to sustain over the long term, and eventually it petered down to just one friend, who would send me jokes during the day and come and keep me company in the evenings — someone I got to know a whole lot better during this period of convalescence.
That was 21 years ago, and for 19 of those years, I have been married to that marvelous introvert who never in a million years would have approached me under other circumstances.
I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and bruises.
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion and desires for intimacy that I also carried.
I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my childhood but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian, because I can just fade into my empathy.
Before shooting this series, I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they fought.
So, as a child, I used to spend all of my time at my great-grandmother's house.
I cannot tell you or describe to you how outraged, mad and angry I was.
I myself was a victim of sexual assault, back many decades ago, when I was in law school.
I was even more horrified to learn — if I could be more horrified — that the oldest of those kits — one of the oldest of those kits — belonged to an eight-year-old girl.
In fact, I thought I was so brilliant that I not only got rather lazy with studying the game, but I also got more risky, started playing in the biggest tournaments I could against the very best in the world.
For 20 years, I've been obsessed with one question: What do we, what do all of us need in order to be healthy?
Even as a little kid, I knew we lived in the shadow of financial and emotional collapse.
I'm an accounting professor, and I do fraud research.
But if I'm being completely honest with myself, I am really conflicted with this message that I'm sending to my students.
So how can I, as a professor who really cares about her students encourage them to become whistle-blowers, when I know how the world truly feels about them?
I am a shopaholic —
You see, I'm a global solutions director for top-tier retail, and we were in a meeting with one of my largest customers, discussing how to streamline costs.
I was horrified. I'm like, "Of all people, I should be able to help prevent this."
In 2013, I was an executive at an international engineering firm in San Francisco.
After all, I was the so-called expert there, the former 20-year television news anchor and life and business coach.
It was this toy called a Pleo that I had ordered, and I was really excited about it because I've always loved robots.
Although since then I've become a mother, nine months ago, and I've learned that babies also squirm when you hold them upside down. (Laughter) But my response to this robot was also interesting because I knew exactly how this machine worked, and yet I still felt compelled to be kind to it.
As both a researcher who studies differences in how individuals' brains wire and rewire themselves, and as a Touretter with other related diagnoses, I have long been fascinated by failures of self-regulation on the impulsive and compulsive behavioral spectrums.
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?
I have had hundreds of encounters. They have taught me something important that I want to share with you. I was born in Turkey from Kurdish parents and we moved to Denmark when I was a young child.
Several weeks later I was at a friend's house, and I was very upset and angry about all the hate and racism I had met.
Even our prejudices were alike. (Laughter) Ingolf told me that when he waits for the bus and the bus stops 10 meters away from him, it was because the driver was a "raghead." I recognized that feeling. When I was young and I waited for the bus and it stopped 10 meters away from me, I was sure that the driver was a racist.
As a young child, I hated different population groups.
They have formed me as a democratic citizen and a bridge builder.
Maybe at this point, do you think I am an idealist?
It wasn't until after I committed to this project that I realized I had it all wrong.
I'm a social scientist. I study the psychology of good people, and research in my field says many of us care deeply about feeling like a good person and being seen as a good person.
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators, and I try and understand how beams behave.
When that same person challenged my ideas, it felt terrible, I felt humiliated and ashamed.
In my job as a technology advisor, I've seen so many companies make the well-meaning decisions to put huge investments into technology, only to have the benefits fail to live up to the expectation.
I have been a librarian for a lot of years.
And in the past few years, I myself have paid over 500 dollars in late fines.
But like all of our friends at the library, I am busy, I lose track of things, my house is sometimes messy, and I have lost a DVD or two under the sofa.
And I have been fortunate enough to be able to pay that 500 dollars over the last several years.
As Michael might have mentioned, I've been a librarian for 15 years and my mom hasn't been in a library in decades, because when she was young, she lost a book.
As a bioethicist, a lawyer, a philosopher and an Iranian-American, I'm deeply concerned about what this means for our freedoms and what kinds of protections we need.
What you're seeing is my brain activity when I was relaxed and curious.
This may all sound great, and as a bioethicist, I am a huge proponent of empowering people to take charge of their own health and well-being by giving them access to information about themselves, including this incredible new brain-decoding technology. But I worry. I worry that we will voluntarily or involuntarily give up our last bastion of freedom, our mental privacy.
As a kid, I looked at them, and I saw everything I wasn't.
They had big muscles, supermodel good looks, and phenomenal cosmic powers. And me? I kind of looked like this, except shorter and with frizzier hair, and I never felt powerful.
Please do not trouble me when I am focused.
I was the first-ever data analyst at Interscope Records.
I been so pressed that I don't even know
In 2006, 12 years ago, I laid across a mattress on my floor in my one-bedroom apartment, frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community.
I'm exhausted, and I'm numb.
When I was in high school at the age of 17 — I graduated from high school in Decatur, Georgia, as valedictorian of my high school — I was very proud of myself.
I was mildly interested in meeting him. It was kind of cool. I was more intrigued by the fact that he lived in a mansion, because I watched a lot of "General Hospital" and "Dynasty" as a child. (Laughter) And so I got up that morning, ready to go to visit the governor.
I wanted to open those gates as an ally of the LGBTQ community.
And I know that the questions I have to ask myself are: One, am I honest about the scope of my ambition?
And to be honest, for many years, my answer would be," I don't know.
I mean, who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions to the train station. Right? I wanted to read "Harry Potter" instead, because that was my favorite book as a child, and I have read it many times.
I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke in German when watching "Friends." I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day two more episodes, and as I kept watching, I had more and more of those moments of understanding, these little victories, and step by step, I got to a level where I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything.
As a language mentor, I help people learn languages by themselves, and I see this every day.
I am a scientist who is passionate about bubbles.
As a scientist who is passionate about bubbles, I love to see them, I love to play with them, and I love to study them.
For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia.
I am trained to put out many different types of fires.
But I am not trained to deal with the intricate interaction between first responders, the health care community, social services and the wider community that is necessary to save a life long-term.
As a first responder, I consider myself the cavalry.
The job of a first responder: prevent unnecessary deaths. Period. So... Obviously, I'm a stubborn firefighter and nurse. And I refuse to believe that there isn't a way around every barrier.
As a museum curator, I understand why these stories are so seductive.
I am so proudly and inextricably both.
As an Afro-Latina curator, I'm one of very few.
And I have been tested.
As a museum curator, I am empowered to change that narrative.
When this work was on view, it was one of our most Instagrammed pieces, and visitors told me they connected with the everyday elements of her brown skin or her rollers or her jewelry.
When we got to the door, a white man was standing in the doorway with a shotgun, and he said, "Bitch, I'll blow your brains out!" And before I could even react, before I could even process what was going on, Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse, and I fell back, thinking that I was dead.
On that day, which was one of the most important days in my life, I saw both love and hate coming from two very different white men that represented the best and the worst of white America. So deep was my hurt at seeing Tom Coleman murder Jonathan before my eyes, that I became a silent person, and I did not speak for six months.
As a Christian, I believe that God created this incredible planet that we live on and gave us responsibility over every living thing on it.
I'm a Christian, I care about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it, a "threat multiplier." It takes those issues, like poverty and hunger and disease and lack of access to clean water and even political crises that lead to refugee crises.
I'm not a Rotarian. But when I gave my first talk at a Rotary Club, I walked in and they had this giant banner that had the Four-Way Test on it.
I'm a climate scientist, so the irony of traveling around to talk to people about a changing climate is not lost on me. (Laughter) The biggest part of my personal carbon footprint is my travel.
ecru... carmine. Now, if you haven't noticed, I am black, thank you —
I was eventually saved by a girl walking near the pool who happened to look down and see me.
In fact, I felt like I was taking crazy pills.
Or maybe it's as simple as standing up on the job in support of yourself or your coworkers.
In my work as a researcher and educator, I've had an opportunity to work with girls like Stacy, a girl who I profile in my book "Pushout," who struggles with her participation in violence.
I remind myself that the heart can simply break, or it can break open.
I am sick and tired of the women I know being sick and tired.
Growing up, I was very close to my father.
I was very upset.
So I ran for a public office as an independent candidate in Lower Dir in the local elections in 2001.
I built alliances with other elected women members, and last year, we women were allowed to sit together with all the members in the council.
So when the jury selection process took place, they asked me, "Could you, if the evidence presented justified the death penalty, could you deliver, rationally and without reservations, a penalty of death?" My answer was an astounding "yes," and I was selected as Juror Number 2.
He was just a murderer. Get over it. It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor.
And I asked her, "Did that make me a murderer?" She couldn't answer.
Now, as a former middle school teacher, I'm not saying that magically everyone is suddenly going to become an A student.
Some people say that I should study to become a climate scientist so that I can "solve the climate crisis." But the climate crisis has already been solved.
But deep down, I was sure she wanted to give it a try.
That feeling was very special, because I am not meant to be useful.
Will I go to college? "And she would reply back," Try to finish high school first. "I am sure my mother did not mean to discourage me.
Of the 97 fellows selected that year, I was the only rural college graduate.
I felt alienated, intimidated and judged by many.
This was a grassroots organization, and I was recruited to be a volunteer.
But words can hardly convey my excitement when I was chosen as an early career scientist by Lee Berger, a world-renowned paleoanthropologist, to be one of the primary analysts of recently excavated unpublished fossils.
The research team that I was invited to join was tasked with describing, comparing and analyzing the fossils, with the difficult goal of identifying to what species the fossils belonged.
And then you have me, the teacher, standing there in the corner, like, about to have a panic attack.
So as a classroom teacher, I have to make split-second decisions all the time.
But I do remember hearing, over and over, growing up: there are two things you do not talk about at family get-togethers.
But if a student ever brings something to my attention and I don't know the answer, I will always admit it and own it because I'm not going to pretend to be an expert in something that I don't have experience in or I'm not an authority on.
You are an imposter, and we will remove you. "But I was the only known face of the movement. Why? Because I was the only stupid one.
So it's much easier. When I'm angry at the government, I just make an angry note, and I send it out and thousands of people share it.
But I'm pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction that is very different from what happened at school. So what are the factors of 30?
For example, I know and I feel that as an Asian person, I am less privileged than white people because of white privilege.
So, I'm sure in the next couple of days there will be yet another news story about the existential risk, robots taking over and coming for your jobs.
But I feel incredibly positive about this technology.
