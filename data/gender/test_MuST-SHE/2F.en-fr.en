And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
And they're not just going to die of measles. What about polio? Let's have that. Why not? A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident.
When I found the captain, he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one of the worst days of her life.
That means we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived around six million years ago.
So here, we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game.
And I want you to see, this is Fuku, a young female, and she is quietly playing with water.
Let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured, and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now.
And one night, there's a knock at his hotel room door. He answers the door. Standing before him is a gorgeous, scantily clad showgirl.
She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.
Most females like me — I believe myself to be a typical female — I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up, but I think I'm probably typical — most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year when South African runner, Caster Semenya, had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
Simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months, she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does — the right to consent to sex, the right to vote, the right to drink.
And what we know from cross-cultural studies is that females, on average — not everyone, but on average — are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are, basically, vulnerable within the group.
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me, she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands.
You not only get to cover science, but you get to meet interesting scientists, like my PhD advisor Revi Sterling, she, of the magic research high tops there.
And it was a discussion with Revi that brought us to the edge of the researcher and reporter, that fuzzy boundary.
In Guatemala, for 70 cents a day, you can help a child like Vilma get the clothes she needs to attend school.
And that's when I made my first mistake; I sent her home.
I sent her home without speaking to my attending.
The three words are: Do you remember? "Do you remember that patient you sent home?" the other nurse asked matter-of-factly. "Well she's back," in just that tone of voice.
She was back and near death.
About an hour after she had arrived home, after I'd sent her home, she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50, which is in severe shock.
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.
And I went through this roller coaster, because after they stabilized her, she went to the intensive care unit, and I hoped against hope that she would recover.
And at about the nine day mark, they let her go — Mrs. Drucker, a wife, a mother and a grandmother.
And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift, and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.
Women as well were banned, but now they've been allowed.
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations, about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago. Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go — that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today.
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died — already in an arranged marriage, already with two small girls.
My mother was exhausted each night, but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition, angry and inflexible, and troubled children caught between two worlds.
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident, was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist, invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb — a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years, telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.
Her mother raised her alone.
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.
I knew she had come to say goodbye.
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world, it wasn't an MIT professor, it wasn't a CalTech student, it was a person from England, from Manchester, a woman who, during the day, was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and, at night, was the world's best protein folder.
She was tough, she was strong, she was powerful.
She was born in the 1880's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world.
And my grandmother was tough, but she was also loving.
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.
And Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then, and she would get together with two of her dearest friends, these older women, Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott — amazing African-American woman — and Virginia Durr, a white woman, whose husband, Clifford Durr, represented Dr. King.
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk, and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said, "Now Bryan, tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is.
I gave her my whole rap, and when I finished she looked at me and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm." She said, "That's going to make you tired, tired, tired." (Laughter) And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face, she said, "That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave."
Thanks very much. I am Hannah Fry, the badass.
Anne's a transgender female, and as her and I started talking, she was sharing with me about what brought her into treatment, but I could hear this fear in her voice, and I could see this worry in her eyes, and she began to tell me that she didn't fear coming into rehab and having to give up drugs and alcohol.
And what she meant by that is, when she was born, the doctor held her up to her parents and based on her genitalia said, "It's a boy." She always knew she wasn't a boy.
She extended her hand to the doctor and said, "Hi, I'm Leah." The doctor looked at her, didn't shake her hand and said, "Why are you here?" She took another deep breath and said, "Well, I'm a transgender female.
And the opposite is, as we talked earlier, a transgender female, someone that's assigned male at birth but lives their live and sense of self as a female.
She's far too leggy, she's far too hairy, and she's far too big to ever be trusted.
You see, she's not so insignificant anymore now, is she?
She wakes up every morning, tired from the night before, baby attached to her breast, dropping this kid off at school, and taking this one to the park.
And she... There was no thinking she wasn't serious when she peered at the audience, and I thought, "Surely she's looking at me." "You know, I'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey.
Do we accept Emmanuel Macron's imagination of Africa in 2017 as a place in which all women have seven or eight children?
Another student gave us feedback that she had learned to design with empathy, as opposed to designing for functionality, which is what her engineering education had taught her.
So I walked up to see her in my lunch break, and my doctor said she was very sorry to tell me that I had breast cancer.
And I was figuring out how I was going to tell my mother, who had herself had breast cancer when she was pregnant with me.
Hi. My name's Sarah, and I've been priced out of the housing market.
to extend my support to the women who do not know who to turn to when they face serious threats online.
She pointed out that I was taking the wrong approach to solving this problem — and she later became my wife.
That she can't forget how, growing up, she was called a dirty Jew with horns and tails.
But Lisa knows she can pass as white so she benefits from huge systemic and interpersonal privileges, and so she spends every day grappling with ways that she can leverage that white privilege for social justice.
My older sister Claire, she became a young mother... and a master at getting things done.
And a couple of months before I met her, she'd had the operation.
And when she sat down, she inspired a nation to stand.
On average, it's estimated that 50 women were fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes.
And she, like me, was born and raised in a family of committed liberal democrats.
She's an actress, she's in her 60s.
She's super bright, badass, emotionally intelligent.
It was really crowded, as it is around the holidays, and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused.
He apparently needed something that she was blocking, so he moved her.
Maybe he had said something to her, maybe he didn't, she didn't hear it... Either way, she was focused, she was filling out the form.
And the next thing you know, there were hands on her, and she was being moved out of the way.
She said that she was shocked at first — yeah.
When women get manhandled, we start to rationalize, try to figure out the ways that it was — "It was probably our fault. You know what? He probably said something, and I didn't hear him.
Women have been trained to think that we are overreacting or that we're being too sensitive or unreasonable.
I asked my mom, who was an artist, when I was in third grade, how a car worked, so she had no idea so she gave me a book, and I read it, and sure enough, my first job out of my mechanical engineering degree was with Chrysler Motors in the automotive industry.
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event, and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think.
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male." But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha.
She pulls back the covers and makes the gruesome discovery. Vera was dead. When it comes to Spanish flu, those stories are common, of lightning speed deaths.
The answer is not Africans this time. (Laughter) And it's not black women or men, and it's not Latin women or men. It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.
As soon as I hung up, she comes to me and says, "I didn't know you could do that.
Ever since I was a young girl, I was always fascinated —
I watched in horror heartbreaking footage of the head nurse, Malak, in the aftermath of the bombing, grabbing premature babies out of their incubators, desperate to get them to safety, before she broke down in tears. And I felt devastated.
People survive because of people like Malak, who, despite sustaining a severe burns injury in the line of duty, the first thing she did when discharged from hospital was to go back caring for small children.
So here's how it looks from a banana-peel-universe point of view, from my mindset, which I call "Emily's universe." First of all, I am incredibly grateful for life, but I don't want to be immortal.
I got a phone call from a 30-something friend, a woman, she said, "So, my partner and I were in the middle of doing some things and I was like, 'I want you right now.' And he said, 'No, you're still dry, you're just being nice.' And I was so ready.
Another friend, back in college, told me about her first experiences of power play in a sexual relationship.
She told me that her partner tied her up with her arms over her head like this, she's standing up and he positions her so she's straddling a bar, presses up against her clitoris, like this.
It's a power play. Leaves her alone. So there's my friend, and she goes, "I'm bored."
And the guy comes back and she says, "I am bored." And he looks at her and he looks at the bar and he says, "Then why are you wet?" Why was she wet?
She was with a partner, a new partner, glad to be doing things, and they reached a point where that was as far as she was interested in going and so she said no.
A little easier for your friend on the phone, worried that she's broken.
Finally, the doors opened, and she said, "She's gone.
She's gone. "She started sobbing and immediately said," We must make arrangements.
Your grandmother's dying wish was to be buried back home in Korea. "
Then I became an investor, a woman in tech, a teacher.
Now, as for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me. It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there.
One was a British schoolgirl, who had been taken off of a plane at London Heathrow as she was trying to make her way to Syria to join ISIS.
She was a self-described tiny filmmaker.
She was also a terrific public speaker, talking with children and adults of all ages all over the world.
Some of the responses I received helped me with the intense grieving process because of their humor, like this email I received from a woman reader who read the article, declaring, "I will marry you when you are ready —
When Sadiye found me at the end of the night she was horrified, and we got back on the phone. We called everyone. We called surgeons and pain docs and general practitioners — anyone we could find on the internet, and not a single one of them would help me.
When my desperation was clearly coming through my voice, much as it is now, the receptionist took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Rieder, it sounds like perhaps what you need is a rehab facility or a methadone clinic." I didn't know any better at the time, so I took her advice.
She kissed her daughter goodbye, left her home, never to return.
They wanted her piecemealed, papier-mâchéd, practically broken, limp-like and loveless, a litany of exaggeration.
They wanted her low. And high. Flat and wide. Filled with all of their empty.
Oh, they wanted her bland. And barren. Unspirited, un-African, uncultured, under siege in the streets.
Oh, they wanted her holy, baptized in her divine, they wanted her secrets, pearls to swine.
Oh, they wanted her complete.
They wanted her whole, though they came fractioned, half-hearted, half-soul, with no regards and no knowledge as to who she really was.
And today, Kerabai is doing a regular radio program, and not only that, she's become a famous radio jockey and she has been invited by all of the radios, even from Mumbai.
She has taken a course in a business school, and she has become a veterinary doctor.
She did successful goat deliveries in the region and she became a famous goat doctor.
Today they are pushing me to go to National Stock Exchange to set up the first fund dedicated to micro rural women entrepreneurs.
It wasn't so long ago that you could purchase a Teen Talk Barbie that when the cord was pulled, it would say things like, "Will we ever have enough clothes?" and "Math class is tough." And just a few years ago, major retailers were marketing T-shirts at our young girls that read things like, "I'm too pretty to do math," or, "I'm too pretty to do my homework so my brother does it for me." And let's not forget about the parents.
And I'll be honest: I was a young, naive, Sri Lankan girl,
My mother was his second wife, married to him at the age of 16.
I remember my mother was pregnant, when she would take turns to carry me and my younger sister.
There, I found my father's first wife, my half sisters and my half brothers.
My mother had been left behind in the camp, and I had not seen her since I left it.
But then, one of my best friends, a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha, called me during this devastating moment, and she was like, "Mary, you have a strong will.
Sometimes they will jokingly say, "You are going to lose your market value the more educated you become." But the truth is, an educated woman is feared in my community.
My name is Halima Aden and I'm a black, Muslim, Somali-American from Kenya.
Some have called me a trailblazer — I was the first Muslim homecoming queen at my high school, the first Somali student senator at my college and the first hijab-wearing woman in many places, like the Miss Minnesota USA beauty pageant, the runways of Milan and New York Fashion Weeks and even on the historic cover of British "Vogue." As you can see, I'm not afraid to be the first, to step out on my own, to take risks and seek change, because that's what being a minority is about.
And because she can't appear in photographs, Samantha decides to write a piece of music that will capture a moment of her life just like a photograph would.
It goes something like this: a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned.
She says, "I'm not good at this.
But she isn't reassured. "It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists.
So I say, "OK. What did you expect it to feel like?" She says, "I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
I was getting calls with questions like this from hundreds of women, all concerned that something was wrong, because they couldn't measure up.
But at the same time, her mind is pushing away, because she remembers there are all these other parts to her identity — other relationships, her work, hobbies, a spiritual and intellectual life, not to mention physical needs: to sleep, to eat, to exercise, to have sex, to go to the bathroom, alone —
If women understood the natural progression of matrescence, if they knew that most people found it hard to live inside this push and pull, if they knew that under these circumstances, ambivalence was normal and nothing to be ashamed of, they would feel less alone, they would feel less stigmatized, and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression.
We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter, who did all my illustrations.
Her daughter's been taken hostage by an android, and of course, she's in a state of shock.
My local TV station reported live from outside the hospital of a Cambridge scientist who was in a coma, and they didn't know if she would live or die or walk or talk.
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the threesome."
If we're going to see a cultural shift in this atrocity, we need men talking to other men about the underlying issues fueling demand. Because sometimes, Johns don't even know that they're purchasing girls who are enslaved.
These two Kenyan ladies were best friends from neighboring villages, but they'd stopped seeing each other, literally, for 10 years, because both had gone blind from a curable condition called cataracts.
They present impossible and perilous choices: Do you take your child to get her flu medicine, or do you feed her?
And identifying as an African-American woman, I know things have gotten better.
And I often wondered if, you know, how did they perceive me, this woman in uniform?
I was even more horrified to learn — if I could be more horrified — that the oldest of those kits — one of the oldest of those kits — belonged to an eight-year-old girl.
Terrified that Natasha was going to lose her grandmother, she went with him.
She was grabbed from behind, and she felt what she thought was a gun, in her side.
Our story is about a girl named Iris.
She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up when things just get to her.
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group.
She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
A few weeks ago, I met a colleague whose mom was diagnosed with incurable cancer, and she said, "Niels, it's hard.
Isn't she cute? (Laughter)
And one of them started crying — her name is Yahara. She started crying. I said, "Why are you crying?" She said, "I'm crying because I had come to believe — always seeing us represented as poor people — I had come to believe that maybe, yes, maybe we are inferior.
Hi. My name is Aparna. I am a shopaholic —
As a white, cisgendered woman in the United States, there are many ways I'm very privileged.
I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead amongst the millennials, and I quickly learned that I had as much to offer them as they did to me.
Early on, Laura Hughes could see that I was a little lost in this habitat, so she often sat right next to me in meetings so she could be my tech translator, and I could write her notes and she could tell me, "That's what that means." Laura was 27 years old, she'd worked for Google for four years and then for a year and a half at Airbnb when I met her.
For women under the age of 30, that number looks like one in 10.And that leaves a few of you in this audience as potential victims.
And I freed myself from the fear of judgment from the one person who I thought would judge me the most — my son, who actually told me, "Mom, you are the strongest person that I know.
Although since then I've become a mother, nine months ago, and I've learned that babies also squirm when you hold them upside down.
I know someone who overdosed, who was revived by Narcan, and she was mostly angry that she wasn't simply allowed to die.
Belle Gibson was a happy young Australian.
But Belle was determined.
She'd been a fighter her whole life.
And she made a complete recovery.
In 2007, I ran for a seat in the Danish parliament as one of the first women with a minority background.
Now that may seem like a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger, but she's not alone.
Like, for example, when I got an email from a female student in my class saying that a reading I had assigned, a reading I had been assigning for years, was sexist.
Some of the toughest stories we hear are actually from women who, in these places where domestic violence can be kind of common, they tell us that they have to hide it from their husbands that they're coming to the clinic.
And it didn't just affect her, it affected me.
So, I started a company called Boxed in our garage, and this was it — I know it doesn't seem like much — you know, there's a pressure washer in the back — this is "living the dream." And my wife was really proud of me when we started this, or that's what she said, she was really proud of me — and so she would give me a hug, and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up and she was thinking, "Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"
So I would never dare call my wife — or if she called me and said, "Hey, hon, bring some pads on the way home," and I said, "Babe, you know, there's a trade war going on, the economy's not that good, so no luxury goods this month but next month I promise —
And she told him she grew up visiting her local library, she loved it.
As Michael might have mentioned, I've been a librarian for 15 years and my mom hasn't been in a library in decades, because when she was young, she lost a book.
Alan Crickmore: Sophie and her mum listened to that three times, and they haven't laughed so much in a long time.
My tías were cops and paramedics, my abuelas were seamstresses and sold jewelry up the street, and my mom got her master's degree in education and taught kindergarten in New York City public schools for over 30 years.
And I don't know how much time you've spent with Puerto Rican women from the Bronx, but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers.
The funny, the goofy, the gentle — those were my in to storytelling, so much so that I wrote a young-adult novel called "Juliet Takes a Breath," about a chubby, queer Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx navigating sexuality, family and identity.
She's tough, Latina, and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.
And people were so excited, because finally, someone who shared her identities — queer and Latina — would be writing her story. And I saw that, right? And also, when I looked at America, I saw a young Latina in survival mode.
See, because her moms had sacrificed themselves to the universe when she was a kid, and she'd been on her own ever since.
But see, I didn't come to all this compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft on her own.
Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated but a university dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States?
And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You," and America is so excited, she's ready to show off her strength, she's ready to show off her portal-punching skills,
And no one has ever offered her silence and deep reflection as a way to be powerful.
So obviously, I had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong, luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above.
And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.
I talked about this in front of an environmentalist just the other day, and she said, "Why are you defending humans? Humans destroyed the planet.
One of my favorite senior clients — we'll call her Jane — is a poster child for what's old-fashioned in leadership today.
It's about the 60 percent of black girls like me who will be experiencing sexual violence before they turn 18, and the thousands and thousands of low-wage workers who are being sexually harassed right now on jobs that they can't afford to quit.
Because, you see, I didn't just want to open the gates for young black women who had been underestimated and told they don't belong.
Just a few. But in the pursuit, I became the first black woman to ever become the nominee for governor in the history of the United States of America for a major party.
The first American woman to become a self-made millionaire: Madam C. J. Walker... The dresses of the first ladies of the United States... Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to seek the US Democratic party's presidential nomination —
Exceptional women are inspiring and aspirational.
If we can collectively apply that radical notion that women are people, it becomes easier to show women as people are: familiar, diverse, present.
That poem, "Hair," was written and performed by Elizabeth Acevedo, a Dominican-American 2018 National Book Award winner, and it appeared in an award-winning Smithsonian exhibit that I curated.
Respectability politics and idealized femininity influence how we display women and which women we choose to display.
But museums can literally change how hundreds of millions of people see women and which women they see.
She took on six men in her primary, she beat them all, she won the general election, and when she goes to Congress in January, she's going to be the first African-American woman ever to serve her district in Washington, D.C.
As the late, great Shirley Chisholm said — Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman ever to go to Congress and the first woman to run for president in the Democratic party — but Shirley Chisholm said, "If there's no room for you at the table, just pull up a folding chair." And that's what women are doing, all across the country.
Now, I was a young woman, and my place was in the home.
I engaged many women and girls to work with me. It was hard. Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married, because their husbands wouldn't let them work.
One colleague of mine was given away by her family to make amends for a crime her brother had committed.
All these elected women now share, discuss and resolve their problems together.
Let me tell you about two of the women I have been working with: Saira Shams. You can see, this young lady, age 26, she ran for a public office in 2015 in Lower Dir, and she won.
She was unable to run for the public office, so she has become the first female journalist of our region.
But I don't want any girl or any woman to take 23 years of her life to make herself heard.
So she turned and she looked at her dad, and she said, "Dad, I know how you feel, but I don't believe in the death penalty." My son looked at me, shook his head, and said, "Thanks, Mom." And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."
So we have no appointments; she shows up when she wants, but usually waits less than 15 minutes to be seen.
She was reluctant at first.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
I was conditioned to believe that the three identities that defined me — poor village girl — meant that I was to live a life of no voice and no choice.
As a woman, I could not be seen with a cell phone, so I used to huddle his phone under my shawl and type as slowly as possible to ensure that I would not be heard.
My father was confused, my mother was worried, but I felt butterflies in my stomach because I was going to step out of my village for the first time to study in the national capital.
When I saw my mother's first signature on her bidi-rolling wage book, when I felt the hot Delhi air against my face after a 50-hour train journey, when I finally felt free and let myself be, I saw a glimpse of that new world I longed for, a world where a girl like me is no longer a liability or a burden but a person of use, a person of value and a person of worthiness.
I first spotted her in a local college in Tirunelveli during one of my training sessions.
The best part of her story is that she is now back at Bodhi Tree as a trainer working with dedication to make a change in the lives of others like her.
She's the first in her entire village to attend graduation.
And I reminded her that when she got married, she changed her name, and that she took the name of her husband.
She didn't buy it and we didn't speak for years.
They were chastised, they were arrested for pursuing the vote for women in the 1920s.
You may remember her, she was one of the women who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
I first traveled there in 2003, and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.
And that's also because women are used to taking care of people, so they can manage to take care of their husband with dementia, but the other way around is not so easy for the gentlemen.
But there was this woman who was in her 60s.
